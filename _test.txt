YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:

ROUND 0 MESSAGE:
Carol: For our first mission, I propose we include Emily and Bob on the team. This will help us start gathering information about everyone's loyalty without putting too much at stake early in the game.
Dan: Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob for the first mission seems like a balanced approach to start gathering information without overcommitting. I'm in favor of this team. Let's see how everyone else feels about it to ensure we're all on the same page.
Emily (You): I agree with Carol's proposal to include me and Bob on the first mission. It's a balanced approach that allows us to start gathering information without risking too much early on. Observing how the mission unfolds will be crucial for our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with this team and pay close attention to the results.
Alice: I see the logic in Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. It's a calculated risk that could provide us with early insights into their loyalties based on the mission's outcome. I'm inclined to support this team to see how things unfold, as the information we gain will be invaluable for our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with this team and carefully analyze the results.
Bob: I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and me on this first mission. It's a smart way to start gathering information without revealing too much too soon. I also think it's important to observe how everyone reacts to the mission's outcome. For instance, if someone seems overly eager or hesitant in future team selections, that could be telling. Let's proceed carefully and use this mission to build trust where it's due.



INSTRUCTIONS:
- You are the team leader for the current team. For this round, the team size is  (including yourself). Choose your teammates and announce the reason for this team.
- Your proposal sets the tone for trust or suspicion. Prioritize players who:  
  - Have consistent voting patterns.  
  - Were on previous successful quests (if Good) or failed quests (if Evil).  
  - Avoided extreme accusations or defensiveness.

- Balance the team with proven allies and unproven players to test loyalty.  
- Example: "Let's include [Player X]¡ªthey've voted against failed teams before."  
- Watch reactions: Evil players may over-praise or criticize reasonable proposals.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 0. The game has just begun.
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.


ROUND 0 MESSAGE:
Carol: For our first mission, I propose we include Emily and Bob on the team. This will help us start gathering information about everyone's loyalty without putting too much at stake early in the game.
Dan: Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob for the first mission seems like a balanced approach to start gathering information without overcommitting. I'm in favor of this team. Let's see how everyone else feels about it to ensure we're all on the same page.
Emily: I agree with Carol's proposal to include me and Bob on the first mission. It's a balanced approach that allows us to start gathering information without risking too much early on. Observing how the mission unfolds will be crucial for our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with this team and pay close attention to the results.
Alice: I see the logic in Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. It's a calculated risk that could provide us with early insights into their loyalties based on the mission's outcome. I'm inclined to support this team to see how things unfold, as the information we gain will be invaluable for our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with this team and carefully analyze the results.
Bob (You): I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and me on this first mission. It's a smart way to start gathering information without revealing too much too soon. I also think it's important to observe how everyone reacts to the mission's outcome. For instance, if someone seems overly eager or hesitant in future team selections, that could be telling. Let's proceed carefully and use this mission to build trust where it's due.
Carol: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Dan: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Emily: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.

   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.


ROUND 0 MESSAGE:
Carol: For our first mission, I propose we include Emily and Bob on the team. This will help us start gathering information about everyone's loyalty without putting too much at stake early in the game.
Dan: Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob for the first mission seems like a balanced approach to start gathering information without overcommitting. I'm in favor of this team. Let's see how everyone else feels about it to ensure we're all on the same page.
Emily (You): I agree with Carol's proposal to include me and Bob on the first mission. It's a balanced approach that allows us to start gathering information without risking too much early on. Observing how the mission unfolds will be crucial for our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with this team and pay close attention to the results.
Alice: I see the logic in Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. It's a calculated risk that could provide us with early insights into their loyalties based on the mission's outcome. I'm inclined to support this team to see how things unfold, as the information we gain will be invaluable for our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with this team and carefully analyze the results.
Bob: I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and me on this first mission. It's a smart way to start gathering information without revealing too much too soon. I also think it's important to observe how everyone reacts to the mission's outcome. For instance, if someone seems overly eager or hesitant in future team selections, that could be telling. Let's proceed carefully and use this mission to build trust where it's due.
Carol: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Dan: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.

Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Bob: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Carol: The failure of our first mission is concerning and indicates that either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. While everyone agreed on the team proposal, showing initial unity, the outcome has raised valid suspicions. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out and could be a strategic move to mislead or assess our suspicions. Emily's direct implication of Bob is also something to consider, but we must remain cautious and not jump to conclusions without further evidence. I believe we should closely monitor both Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as how everyone else reacts to this failure, to better identify the Minions among us. Let's use this setback as an opportunity to gather more information and refine our strategy moving forward.
Dan: The failure of our first mission is concerning and points to either Emily or Bob being a Minion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. While everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, showing initial unity, the outcome has raised valid suspicions. Bob's comment about watching reactions post-mission stands out and could be a strategic move to mislead or assess our suspicions.

- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:

  - Were on previous successful quests (if Good) or failed quests (if Evil).  
  - Avoided extreme accusations or defensiveness.

- Balance the team with proven allies and unproven players to test loyalty.  
- Example: "Let's include [Player X]¡ªthey've voted against failed teams before."

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.

- Think strategically as Minion and decide your choice.
- Your chioce will be announced publically to all players.
- Your choice reveals your trust in the team's composition. Use it to:  
  - Signal suspicion or confidence in the leader's judgment.  
  - Influence the group's perception of who is Good or Evil. 

- Approve the team if:  
  - It includes at least one Evil ally (to sabotage the quest).  
  - Rejecting would make you look suspicious (e.g., the team seems reasonable).  
- Reject the team if:  
  - It's full of Loyal players (to force leadership changes and chaos).  
  - Example: "This team feels off. Why exclude [Evil ally]? I'm voting no."

    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan: For this round, I propose including Bob and Carol in the team. Bob's behavior in the previous round was noteworthy, and including him will help us understand his loyalty better. Carol's leadership was accepted by all, indicating potential trustworthiness. This team composition allows us to test suspicions while maintaining a balance of trust.
Emily: I support Dan's proposal to include Bob and Carol in this mission. Bob's previous actions warrant closer scrutiny, and this team composition provides an opportunity to assess his loyalty further. Carol's leadership has shown promise, and I believe this team can help us gather valuable insights. Let's proceed with caution and pay close attention to the mission's outcome to inform our next steps.

It's crucial we remain vigilant and learn from each round's results.
Bob: I appreciate the team's decision to include me and Carol in this mission. It's a fair approach to test my loyalty after the previous round's outcome. Carol has indeed shown strong leadership, and I'm ready to contribute positively to this mission. However, moving forward, we should also consider the consistency in others' behaviors, like why some players are more reserved in taking leadership roles.

   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.

- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan: For this round, I propose including Bob and Carol in the team. Bob's behavior in the previous round was noteworthy, and including him will help us understand his loyalty better. Carol's leadership was accepted by all, indicating potential trustworthiness. This team composition allows us to test suspicions while maintaining a balance of trust.
Emily: I support Dan's proposal to include Bob and Carol in this mission. Bob's previous actions warrant closer scrutiny, and this team composition provides an opportunity to assess his loyalty further. Carol's leadership has shown promise, and I believe this team can help us gather valuable insights. Let's proceed with caution and pay close attention to the mission's outcome to inform our next steps.
Alice (You): I agree with Dan's proposal to include Bob and Carol in this mission. Bob's actions in the previous round raised some concerns, and this is a good opportunity to assess his loyalty. Carol has shown potential as a trustworthy leader. Let's proceed with this team and carefully analyze the mission's outcome to guide our next steps. It's crucial we remain vigilant and learn from each round's results.
Bob: I appreciate the team's decision to include me and Carol in this mission. It's a fair approach to test my loyalty after the previous round's outcome. Carol has indeed shown strong leadership, and I'm ready to contribute positively to this mission. However, moving forward, we should also consider the consistency in others' behaviors, like why some players are more reserved in taking leadership roles. It's crucial we all remain transparent to ensure the success of our missions.
Carol: I support the current team proposal of Bob and myself for this mission. It's a prudent step to test Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome. As a Servant, my priority is the success of our missions and the protection of Merlin. I believe this team composition allows us to gather valuable information while moving closer to our goal. Let's proceed carefully and analyze the results to guide our future decisions.
Dan: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.

Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission.

Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan (You): For this round, I propose including Bob and Carol in the team. Bob's behavior in the previous round was noteworthy, and including him will help us understand his loyalty better. Carol's leadership was accepted by all, indicating potential trustworthiness. This team composition allows us to test suspicions while maintaining a balance of trust.
Emily: I support Dan's proposal to include Bob and Carol in this mission. Bob's previous actions warrant closer scrutiny, and this team composition provides an opportunity to assess his loyalty further. Carol's leadership has shown promise, and I believe this team can help us gather valuable insights. Let's proceed with caution and pay close attention to the mission's outcome to inform our next steps.
Alice: I agree with Dan's proposal to include Bob and Carol in this mission. Bob's actions in the previous round raised some concerns, and this is a good opportunity to assess his loyalty. Carol has shown potential as a trustworthy leader. Let's proceed with this team and carefully analyze the mission's outcome to guide our next steps. It's crucial we remain vigilant and learn from each round's results.
Bob: I appreciate the team's decision to include me and Carol in this mission. It's a fair approach to test my loyalty after the previous round's outcome. Carol has indeed shown strong leadership, and I'm ready to contribute positively to this mission. However, moving forward, we should also consider the consistency in others' behaviors, like why some players are more reserved in taking leadership roles. It's crucial we all remain transparent to ensure the success of our missions.
Carol: I support the current team proposal of Bob and myself for this mission. It's a prudent step to test Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome. As a Servant, my priority is the success of our missions and the protection of Merlin. I believe this team composition allows us to gather valuable information while moving closer to our goal. Let's proceed carefully and analyze the results to guide our future decisions.

I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Bob: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Carol: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan: For this round, I propose including Bob and Carol in the team. Bob's behavior in the previous round was noteworthy, and including him will help us understand his loyalty better. Carol's leadership was accepted by all, indicating potential trustworthiness. This team composition allows us to test suspicions while maintaining a balance of trust.
Emily: I support Dan's proposal to include Bob and Carol in this mission. Bob's previous actions warrant closer scrutiny, and this team composition provides an opportunity to assess his loyalty further. Carol's leadership has shown promise, and I believe this team can help us gather valuable insights. Let's proceed with caution and pay close attention to the mission's outcome to inform our next steps.
Alice: I agree with Dan's proposal to include Bob and Carol in this mission. Bob's actions in the previous round raised some concerns, and this is a good opportunity to assess his loyalty. Carol has shown potential as a trustworthy leader. Let's proceed with this team and carefully analyze the mission's outcome to guide our next steps. It's crucial we remain vigilant and learn from each round's results.
Bob (You): I appreciate the team's decision to include me and Carol in this mission. It's a fair approach to test my loyalty after the previous round's outcome. Carol has indeed shown strong leadership, and I'm ready to contribute positively to this mission. However, moving forward, we should also consider the consistency in others' behaviors, like why some players are more reserved in taking leadership roles. It's crucial we all remain transparent to ensure the success of our missions.
Carol: I support the current team proposal of Bob and myself for this mission. It's a prudent step to test Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome. As a Servant, my priority is the success of our missions and the protection of Merlin. I believe this team composition allows us to gather valuable information while moving closer to our goal. Let's proceed carefully and analyze the results to guide our future decisions.
Dan: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Bob (You): The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty.

My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Carol: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Dan: The failure of this mission with Bob and Carol on the team is deeply concerning. Bob's previous actions were already questionable, and now this outcome makes it hard to ignore the possibility that he's a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt as well. Emily and Alice, your support for the team is noted, but we must remain vigilant. Moving forward, we need to carefully consider our team compositions and pay close attention to everyone's actions and reactions. Let's use this failure as a learning opportunity to uncover the Minions among us and protect Merlin.
Emily: The failure of this mission with Bob and Carol on the team is concerning, especially since we know Bob is a Minion. This outcome suggests that Carol's loyalty may also be in question, given her previous leadership role and commitment to the mission's success. As a Servant, my support for the team was aimed at uncovering more about our opponents' strategies. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach are commendable and suggest her loyalty. Dan's strategic proposal, though it led to a failed mission, has provided us with crucial information. We must now carefully analyze Carol's and Bob's future actions and remain vigilant for any signs of other Minions among us.
Alice: The failure of this mission with Bob and Carol on the team is deeply concerning. Bob's previous actions were already questionable, and this outcome makes it hard to ignore the possibility that he's a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt as well.

{'reasoning': "As Bob the Minion, my goal is to divert suspicion away from myself and possibly onto others, especially since the mission's failure has put Carol and me under scrutiny. Given that Emily is also a Minion, I should avoid implicating her directly. Instead, I can subtly suggest that Alice or Dan might be at fault, as they are likely Loyal Servants. This approach can create confusion among the Loyal Servants and potentially lead them to misidentify their own as Minions. Additionally, by questioning the team selection process, I can cast doubt on the decision-making of the Loyal Servants, further sowing discord.", 'say': "The mission's failure is indeed concerning, and it's clear that we need to reassess our approach. I can't help but wonder why Alice and Dan were so quick to approve the team composition. Their eagerness to include me and Carol, especially after the previous round's outcome, raises questions.

GAME STATE:

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:

   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.

This team balances reliability with the need to test unproven loyalties.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
Emily: For this round, I propose including Alice and Dan on the mission. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, and Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. This team balances reliability with the need to test unproven loyalties.

CURRENT TEAM LEADER IS:
Emily
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Alice the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

{'reasoning': "Given the current team proposal by Emily to include Alice and Dan, and considering the past rounds' outcomes, it's crucial to assess the reliability of the proposed team members. Alice has been consistent in supporting team proposals without being implicated in failures, which aligns with a Loyal Servant's behavior. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the mission's failure, suggests a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is also consistent with a Loyal Servant's objectives. However, the fact that Emily, a known Minion, is proposing this team raises suspicions. It's possible that Emily is trying to appear cooperative while setting up a scenario where the mission can be sabotaged. Therefore, the focus should be on ensuring that the mission succeeds by carefully considering the team composition and being vigilant about potential sabotage.", 'say': "I appreciate Emily's proposal to include Dan and me on the mission. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round was commendable, even if the outcome wasn't what we hoped for. However, given Emily's known allegiance to Mordred, we must be cautious.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.

Dan: I support Emily's proposal to include Alice and me on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and my strategic approach in the last round align with our goal of completing three successful missions. However, as Bob mentioned, we should consider the possibility of Alice's support being a strategy to avoid suspicion. Let's proceed with this team but remain observant of the outcomes and each other's reactions to further narrow down our suspicions.

{'reasoning': "Given that Emily is a known Minion, her proposal to include me and Dan on the mission is suspicious. While Dan's strategic approach in the last round was commendable, the fact that Emily, a Minion, is leading this proposal raises concerns. It's possible that this is an attempt to manipulate the team composition to their advantage.

- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
Emily: For this round, I propose including Alice and Dan on the mission. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, and Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. This team balances reliability with the need to test unproven loyalties.
Alice: I appreciate Emily's proposal to include Dan and me on the mission. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round was commendable, even if the outcome wasn't what we hoped for. However, given Emily's known allegiance to Mordred, we must be cautious. I support this team composition but urge everyone to consider the implications of Emily's leadership in proposing it. Let's ensure that our actions align with our goal of completing three successful missions and protecting Merlin.
Bob: I find Emily's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission quite reasonable. Alice has shown consistent support for team proposals, and Dan's strategic approach last round was indeed commendable, despite the unfortunate outcome. However, I can't help but wonder about Alice's unwavering support¡ªcould it be a strategy to avoid suspicion? Regardless, this team seems balanced for now, and I'm inclined to support it. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes.
Carol: Emily's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission is a step towards testing unproven loyalties, which is essential at this stage. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic thinking are commendable, but we must remain vigilant. Given the previous mission failures, it's imperative that we carefully analyze the outcomes of this mission to further narrow down our suspicions.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:

Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties.

Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect.

    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
Emily: For this round, I propose including Alice and Dan on the mission. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, and Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. This team balances reliability with the need to test unproven loyalties.
Alice (You): I appreciate Emily's proposal to include Dan and me on the mission. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round was commendable, even if the outcome wasn't what we hoped for. However, given Emily's known allegiance to Mordred, we must be cautious. I support this team composition but urge everyone to consider the implications of Emily's leadership in proposing it. Let's ensure that our actions align with our goal of completing three successful missions and protecting Merlin.
Bob: I find Emily's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission quite reasonable. Alice has shown consistent support for team proposals, and Dan's strategic approach last round was indeed commendable, despite the unfortunate outcome. However, I can't help but wonder about Alice's unwavering support¡ªcould it be a strategy to avoid suspicion? Regardless, this team seems balanced for now, and I'm inclined to support it. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes.
Carol: Emily's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission is a step towards testing unproven loyalties, which is essential at this stage. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic thinking are commendable, but we must remain vigilant. Given the previous mission failures, it's imperative that we carefully analyze the outcomes of this mission to further narrow down our suspicions. I support this team composition for now, but let's all pay close attention to the results and each other's reactions post-mission to better understand our allegiances.
Dan: I support Emily's proposal to include Alice and me on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and my strategic approach in the last round align with our goal of completing three successful missions. However, as Bob mentioned, we should consider the possibility of Alice's support being a strategy to avoid suspicion. Let's proceed with this team but remain observant of the outcomes and each other's reactions to further narrow down our suspicions.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.




The team of Alice, Dan with leader Emily failed the mission.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.

Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.

Alice has shown consistent support for team proposals, and Dan's strategic approach last round was indeed commendable, despite the unfortunate outcome. However, I can't help but wonder about Alice's unwavering support¡ªcould it be a strategy to avoid suspicion? Regardless, this team seems balanced for now, and I'm inclined to support it. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes.
Carol: Emily's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission is a step towards testing unproven loyalties, which is essential at this stage. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic thinking are commendable, but we must remain vigilant. Given the previous mission failures, it's imperative that we carefully analyze the outcomes of this mission to further narrow down our suspicions. I support this team composition for now, but let's all pay close attention to the results and each other's reactions post-mission to better understand our allegiances.
Dan (You): I support Emily's proposal to include Alice and me on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and my strategic approach in the last round align with our goal of completing three successful missions. However, as Bob mentioned, we should consider the possibility of Alice's support being a strategy to avoid suspicion. Let's proceed with this team but remain observant of the outcomes and each other's reactions to further narrow down our suspicions.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Bob: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
Emily (You): For this round, I propose including Alice and Dan on the mission. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, and Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. This team balances reliability with the need to test unproven loyalties.
Alice: I appreciate Emily's proposal to include Dan and me on the mission. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round was commendable, even if the outcome wasn't what we hoped for.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.

    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
Emily: For this round, I propose including Alice and Dan on the mission. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, and Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. This team balances reliability with the need to test unproven loyalties.
Alice: I appreciate Emily's proposal to include Dan and me on the mission. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round was commendable, even if the outcome wasn't what we hoped for. However, given Emily's known allegiance to Mordred, we must be cautious. I support this team composition but urge everyone to consider the implications of Emily's leadership in proposing it. Let's ensure that our actions align with our goal of completing three successful missions and protecting Merlin.
Bob (You): I find Emily's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission quite reasonable. Alice has shown consistent support for team proposals, and Dan's strategic approach last round was indeed commendable, despite the unfortunate outcome. However, I can't help but wonder about Alice's unwavering support¡ªcould it be a strategy to avoid suspicion? Regardless, this team seems balanced for now, and I'm inclined to support it. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes.
Carol: Emily's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission is a step towards testing unproven loyalties, which is essential at this stage. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic thinking are commendable, but we must remain vigilant. Given the previous mission failures, it's imperative that we carefully analyze the outcomes of this mission to further narrow down our suspicions. I support this team composition for now, but let's all pay close attention to the results and each other's reactions post-mission to better understand our allegiances.
Dan: I support Emily's proposal to include Alice and me on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and my strategic approach in the last round align with our goal of completing three successful missions. However, as Bob mentioned, we should consider the possibility of Alice's support being a strategy to avoid suspicion. Let's proceed with this team but remain observant of the outcomes and each other's reactions to further narrow down our suspicions.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.

Emily: The failure of this mission with Alice and Dan on the team is deeply concerning.

Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Moving forward, we must scrutinize their actions closely. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite his known status, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty.

Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Bob: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.

Emily: The failure of this mission with Alice and Dan on the team is deeply concerning. Given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known allegiance to Mordred, it's evident that one of them is the second Minion. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Moving forward, we must scrutinize their actions closely. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite his known status, adds another layer of complexity.

Bob: The failure of this mission is indeed troubling. Given Emily's known allegiance and my own, it's clear that one between Alice and Dan is the other Minion. Alice's consistent support for team proposals has always seemed a bit too convenient, and now it's starting to look like a strategy to avoid suspicion. Dan's strategic approach, while commendable, could also be a cover for his true intentions. We need to be very careful in our next moves to ensure we don't let the Minions manipulate us further.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.

GAME STATE:

- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability.

   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.




Team 1 is Alice, Dan.




CURRENT TEAM IS:
Alice, Dan

CURRENT TEAM LEADER IS:
Alice
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Dan the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

{'reasoning': "Given the observations from previous rounds, it's clear that the Minions are adept at blending in and manipulating the team's trust.

Alice's consistent support for team proposals before this round suggests her loyalty, but the recent failure raises questions.

Carol's absence from recent teams and her mixed outcomes make her a wildcard. My goal is to ensure the success of the next mission while protecting Merlin.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.

    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob (You): I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.



INSTRUCTIONS:
- You are the team leader for the current team. For this round, the team size is  (including yourself). Choose your teammates and announce the reason for this team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.

Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion.

- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily (You): I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable. However, given Bob's likely role, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be crucial in assessing their loyalties further. Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further. I support proceeding with this team but urge everyone to analyze the results carefully to protect our cause.

- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable. However, given Bob's likely role, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be crucial in assessing their loyalties further. Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further. I support proceeding with this team but urge everyone to analyze the results carefully to protect our cause.
Emily: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have demonstrated qualities aligned with our cause. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is commendable, and my agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, necessitates caution. This mission's outcome will be crucial in assessing Alice's loyalty further. Let's proceed carefully, remain vigilant, and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Alice (You): I support the current team of Emily and myself for this mission, as it provides an opportunity to test Emily's loyalty further. However, given Bob's known allegiance and his endorsement of this team, we must proceed with heightened vigilance. The outcome of this mission will be telling, and I urge everyone to analyze the results carefully. Let's remain focused on our goal of completing three successful missions while protecting Merlin's identity.

{'reasoning': "Given the current team composition of Emily and Alice, and considering Bob's known allegiance as a Minion, his endorsement of this team raises significant concerns. Emily's previous agreement with balanced approaches and Alice's consistent support for team proposals are positive, but the context of Bob's leadership and his likely strategy to manipulate the team's composition for Evil's benefit cannot be overlooked. Additionally, the rejection of the previous team (Alice and Dan) suggests that the group is wary of certain combinations, possibly due to hidden Minion activities. Therefore, joining this team under Bob's leadership could risk another mission failure, which is detrimental to the Loyal Servants' cause. It's strategic to reject this team to signal distrust in Bob's leadership and to encourage a reevaluation of team composition that excludes known Minions and their likely endorsements.", 'approve': 'no'}

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Dan the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty.

   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily (You): I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable. However, given Bob's likely role, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be crucial in assessing their loyalties further. Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Emily the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

GAME STATE:

- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable. However, given Bob's likely role, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be crucial in assessing their loyalties further. Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further. I support proceeding with this team but urge everyone to analyze the results carefully to protect our cause.

Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.

Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission.

   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily (You): I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable.

Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident.

Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's balanced perspective adds value. However, I can't help but question Carol's repeated absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the mixed outcomes raise concerns. Perhaps it's time to reconsider her role in future missions to ensure we're not missing anything. For now, I support this team and believe it's a step in the right direction to uncover the truth.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty.

This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.

Let's proceed with caution and use this opportunity to gather more insights into everyone's loyalties.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission. This composition allows us to test Emily's loyalty further while leveraging Dan's strategic approach and my consistent support for our cause. However, given Bob's known allegiance, we must proceed with caution. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in assessing our next steps. Let's remain focused and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's balanced perspective adds value. However, I can't help but question Carol's repeated absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the mixed outcomes raise concerns. Perhaps it's time to reconsider her role in future missions to ensure we're not missing anything. For now, I support this team and believe it's a step in the right direction to uncover the truth.
Dan: I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Emily the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable.

Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol (You): I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol (You): I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable. However, given Bob's likely role, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be crucial in assessing their loyalties further. Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further. I support proceeding with this team but urge everyone to analyze the results carefully to protect our cause.
Emily: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have demonstrated qualities aligned with our cause. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is commendable, and my agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, necessitates caution. This mission's outcome will be crucial in assessing Alice's loyalty further. Let's proceed carefully, remain vigilant, and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Alice: I support the current team of Emily and myself for this mission, as it provides an opportunity to test Emily's loyalty further. However, given Bob's known allegiance and his endorsement of this team, we must proceed with heightened vigilance. The outcome of this mission will be telling, and I urge everyone to analyze the results carefully. Let's remain focused on our goal of completing three successful missions while protecting Merlin's identity.

However, we must remain vigilant, especially considering Bob's known allegiance and his influence on previous team selections. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing our next steps. Let's proceed with caution and use this opportunity to gather more insights into everyone's loyalties.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission.

Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's balanced perspective adds value. However, I can't help but question Carol's repeated absence from recent teams.

Emily: I find the current team of Alice and Dan to be a reasonable choice, given Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach. However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling. I propose we proceed with this team but remain highly vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in identifying the remaining Minion. Let's focus on protecting Merlin and securing our victory by carefully analyzing the results of this mission.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Carol the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan (You): I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable.

A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.

Emily: I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have demonstrated qualities aligned with our cause. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is commendable, and my agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, necessitates caution.

Let's proceed carefully, remain vigilant, and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Alice: I support the current team of Emily and myself for this mission, as it provides an opportunity to test Emily's loyalty further. However, given Bob's known allegiance and his endorsement of this team, we must proceed with heightened vigilance.

Let's remain focused on our goal of completing three successful missions while protecting Merlin's identity.

Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission.

Emily: I find the current team of Alice and Dan to be a reasonable choice, given Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach. However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.

Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further. I support proceeding with this team but urge everyone to analyze the results carefully to protect our cause.

Emily: I find the current team of Alice and Dan to be a reasonable choice, given Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach. However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling. I propose we proceed with this team but remain highly vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in identifying the remaining Minion. Let's focus on protecting Merlin and securing our victory by carefully analyzing the results of this mission.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Alice the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol (You): I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties. A success would strengthen our trust in them, while a failure would provide valuable information. Let's proceed carefully and remain vigilant to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Bob: I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's consistent support for team proposals aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties.
Carol (You): I support the current team of Emily and Alice, as both have shown qualities that align with our cause. Emily's initial balanced approach and Alice's consistent support are commendable.

Let's proceed carefully and use this opportunity to gather more insights while ensuring the mission's success.
Dan: I acknowledge the proposal to include Emily and Alice on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is noteworthy, and Emily's agreement with balanced approaches has been evident. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, we must remain vigilant. This mission's outcome will be pivotal in assessing loyalties further. I support proceeding with this team but urge everyone to analyze the results carefully to protect our cause.

Alice: I support the current team of Emily and myself for this mission, as it provides an opportunity to test Emily's loyalty further. However, given Bob's known allegiance and his endorsement of this team, we must proceed with heightened vigilance.

However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling. I propose we proceed with this team but remain highly vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in identifying the remaining Minion. Let's focus on protecting Merlin and securing our victory by carefully analyzing the results of this mission.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look.

Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success.

Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob.

The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's and Emily's loyalties further. Let's remain focused on our objective and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Dan (You): I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is commendable, and this mission will be a critical test of Emily's loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.

    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.

Emily (You): I find the current team of Alice and Dan to be a reasonable choice, given Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach. However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling.

For now, let's proceed with Alice and Dan and carefully observe the results to guide our next steps.
Carol: I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is a strong indicator of her loyalty, and Dan's strategic approach, despite past failures, could be key to our success. However, given the pattern of mission failures, we must proceed with caution. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's loyalty further. Let's remain focused and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Emily (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Dan's strategic approach has been valuable, and this mission will be a critical test of his loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced and strategic choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's inclusion offers a fresh perspective that could be crucial for this mission's success. However, I share Carol's concerns about the pattern of mission failures and the need for vigilance. Let's proceed with this team but remain highly attentive to the outcomes. This mission could provide the clarity we need to move forward effectively.
Carol: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily, as it allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. However, given the pattern of mission failures and Bob's likely allegiance, we must proceed with heightened vigilance.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage.

Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob (You): I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable. However, Bob's endorsement, given his known role, raises concerns. This mission will be crucial in testing Alice's and Dan's loyalties.

Bob (You): I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's balanced perspective adds value. However, I can't help but question Carol's repeated absence from recent teams.

Emily: I find the current team of Alice and Dan to be a reasonable choice, given Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach. However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling. I propose we proceed with this team but remain highly vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in identifying the remaining Minion. Let's focus on protecting Merlin and securing our victory by carefully analyzing the results of this mission.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success.

Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Dan's strategic approach has been valuable, and this mission will be a critical test of his loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Bob (You): I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced and strategic choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's inclusion offers a fresh perspective that could be crucial for this mission's success. However, I share Carol's concerns about the pattern of mission failures and the need for vigilance. Let's proceed with this team but remain highly attentive to the outcomes.

Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation.

Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol (You): I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look. For the next mission, I suggest we consider including players who haven't been as heavily involved in recent failures, to reduce the risk of sabotage. Let's use this mission to gather more information, but we must remain vigilant and analyze every outcome carefully to protect Merlin and secure our victory.
Emily: I support Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are commendable.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty.

Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Bob: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.

However, I can't help but notice Carol's repeated absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but given the mixed outcomes, perhaps it's time to reconsider her role in future missions. For now, let's proceed with Alice and Dan and carefully observe the results to guide our next steps.
Carol: I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is a strong indicator of her loyalty, and Dan's strategic approach, despite past failures, could be key to our success. However, given the pattern of mission failures, we must proceed with caution. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's loyalty further. Let's remain focused and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Emily (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Dan's strategic approach has been valuable, and this mission will be a critical test of his loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced and strategic choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's inclusion offers a fresh perspective that could be crucial for this mission's success. However, I share Carol's concerns about the pattern of mission failures and the need for vigilance. Let's proceed with this team but remain highly attentive to the outcomes. This mission could provide the clarity we need to move forward effectively.
Carol: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily, as it allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. However, given the pattern of mission failures and Bob's likely allegiance, we must proceed with heightened vigilance. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's and Emily's loyalties further. Let's remain focused on our objective and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Dan: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is commendable, and this mission will be a critical test of Emily's loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Emily (You): I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Bob: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan.

Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.

ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice (You): For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob (You): I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan: I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look.

Let's remain focused and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Bob (You): I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's balanced perspective adds value. However, I can't help but question Carol's repeated absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the mixed outcomes raise concerns. Perhaps it's time to reconsider her role in future missions to ensure we're not missing anything. For now, I support this team and believe it's a step in the right direction to uncover the truth.
Dan: I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Emily: I find the current team of Alice and Dan to be a reasonable choice, given Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach. However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling. I propose we proceed with this team but remain highly vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in identifying the remaining Minion. Let's focus on protecting Merlin and securing our victory by carefully analyzing the results of this mission.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success.

For now, let's proceed with Alice and Dan and carefully observe the results to guide our next steps.
Carol: I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is a strong indicator of her loyalty, and Dan's strategic approach, despite past failures, could be key to our success. However, given the pattern of mission failures, we must proceed with caution. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's loyalty further. Let's remain focused and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Emily: For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Dan's strategic approach has been valuable, and this mission will be a critical test of his loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Bob (You): I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced and strategic choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's inclusion offers a fresh perspective that could be crucial for this mission's success. However, I share Carol's concerns about the pattern of mission failures and the need for vigilance. Let's proceed with this team but remain highly attentive to the outcomes. This mission could provide the clarity we need to move forward effectively.
Carol: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily, as it allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. However, given the pattern of mission failures and Bob's likely allegiance, we must proceed with heightened vigilance. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's and Emily's loyalties further.

Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Bob (You): The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted.

Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.
Emily: The failure of this mission with Alice, Dan, and myself on the team is deeply concerning. Given my known loyalty as a Servant, the sabotage must have come from either Alice or Dan. Alice's consistent support for team proposals has been a strong point in her favor, but this failure cannot be ignored. Dan's strategic contributions, while previously seeming beneficial, now warrant closer scrutiny. Bob's endorsement of teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known allegiance, adds another layer of complexity to our analysis. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious approach keep her in our considerations, but the immediate evidence points towards Alice and Dan. Moving forward, we must proceed with extreme caution, carefully evaluating each proposal and action to uncover the remaining Minion and protect Merlin. The stakes are high, and our victory depends on our collective vigilance and strategic thinking.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

However, we must remain vigilant, especially considering Bob's known allegiance and his influence on previous team selections. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing our next steps. Let's proceed with caution and use this opportunity to gather more insights into everyone's loyalties.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission. This composition allows us to test Emily's loyalty further while leveraging Dan's strategic approach and my consistent support for our cause. However, given Bob's known allegiance, we must proceed with caution. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in assessing our next steps. Let's remain focused and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's balanced perspective adds value. However, I can't help but question Carol's repeated absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the mixed outcomes raise concerns. Perhaps it's time to reconsider her role in future missions to ensure we're not missing anything. For now, I support this team and believe it's a step in the right direction to uncover the truth.
Dan: I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Emily: I find the current team of Alice and Dan to be a reasonable choice, given Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach. However, the pattern of mission failures is concerning and suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach. Bob's endorsement of this team, given his known role, is particularly troubling. I propose we proceed with this team but remain highly vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be crucial in identifying the remaining Minion. Let's focus on protecting Merlin and securing our victory by carefully analyzing the results of this mission.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. However, given the complexities of recent rounds, it's imperative that we proceed with heightened vigilance. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's loyalty further. Let's remain focused on our objective and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.

For now, let's proceed with Alice and Dan and carefully observe the results to guide our next steps.
Carol (You): I support the current team of Alice and Dan for this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is a strong indicator of her loyalty, and Dan's strategic approach, despite past failures, could be key to our success. However, given the pattern of mission failures, we must proceed with caution. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's loyalty further. Let's remain focused and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Emily: For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Alice: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily for this mission, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Dan's strategic approach has been valuable, and this mission will be a critical test of his loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced and strategic choice. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are commendable, and Emily's inclusion offers a fresh perspective that could be crucial for this mission's success. However, I share Carol's concerns about the pattern of mission failures and the need for vigilance. Let's proceed with this team but remain highly attentive to the outcomes. This mission could provide the clarity we need to move forward effectively.
Carol (You): I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily, as it allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. However, given the pattern of mission failures and Bob's likely allegiance, we must proceed with heightened vigilance. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in assessing Dan's and Emily's loyalties further. Let's remain focused on our objective and analyze the results carefully to ensure our victory and protect Merlin.
Dan: I support the current team of Alice, Dan, and Emily, recognizing the need to proceed with caution given Emily's known allegiance. Alice's consistent support for team proposals is commendable, and this mission will be a critical test of Emily's loyalty. Let's all commit to the mission's success and remain vigilant for any signs of sabotage. The outcome will provide us with valuable information to guide our next steps. Protecting Merlin and achieving three successful missions remains our top priority.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Alice: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Bob: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 3. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.


ROUND 3 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking are qualities we need for mission success. However, I can't help but wonder about Carol's absence from recent teams. Her leadership was initially trusted, but the outcomes have been mixed. Perhaps it's worth considering her for future missions to test her loyalty further.
Carol: I understand the reasoning behind including Alice and Dan in this mission. Alice's consistent support and Dan's strategic approach are indeed valuable. However, given Bob's support for this team, and considering his likely allegiance, we must proceed with caution. I propose we closely observe the outcome of this mission to further assess Alice's and Dan's loyalties. If this mission succeeds, it could clear some doubts; if it fails, it will provide critical information about their true roles. Let's remain vigilant and use this opportunity to gather more insights.
Dan (You): I appreciate Alice's proposal and Bob's support, but given the recent mission's failure, we must proceed with caution. Alice's track record has been consistent until now, and my actions have always been in service of our cause. However, Bob's endorsement, considering his likely role, is concerning. Carol's mixed outcomes also warrant a closer look.

Bob's endorsement of teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known allegiance, adds another layer of complexity to our analysis. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious approach keep her in our considerations, but the immediate evidence points towards Alice and Dan. Moving forward, we must proceed with extreme caution, carefully evaluating each proposal and action to uncover the remaining Minion and protect Merlin. The stakes are high, and our victory depends on our collective vigilance and strategic thinking.
Alice: The failure of this mission with Alice, Dan, and myself on the team is deeply concerning. Given my known loyalty as a Servant, the sabotage must have come from either Alice or Dan. Alice's consistent support for team proposals has been commendable, but this failure cannot be overlooked. Dan's strategic contributions, while previously beneficial, now warrant closer examination.

Bob: The failure of this mission is deeply troubling, especially with Alice and Dan on the team. Alice's consistent support for team proposals has been commendable, but this failure raises serious questions. Dan's strategic contributions, while previously seeming beneficial, now seem suspect. Emily's known loyalty as a Servant leaves Alice and Dan as the only possible saboteurs. Carol's absence from recent teams also warrants attention¡ªperhaps it's time to reconsider her role in future missions. We must proceed with extreme caution and carefully evaluate each player's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.

Round 3 is complete.
STARTING ROUND: 4
The team leader is choosing the teamates
================prompt==============
You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, given her known allegiance and the need to gather more information., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and Emily. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.


ROUND 4 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Carol, Dan, and Emily. Carol has shown cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures. Dan's strategic thinking, despite past outcomes, demonstrates a commitment to our cause. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further, given her known allegiance. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.

- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success.

Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support.

This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.


ROUND 4 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Carol, Dan, and Emily. Carol has shown cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures. Dan's strategic thinking, despite past outcomes, demonstrates a commitment to our cause. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further, given her known allegiance. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Carol, Dan, and Emily on this mission. Carol's reliability and Dan's strategic approach have been evident, and including Emily gives us a chance to further assess her loyalty. This team seems balanced and capable of moving us forward. Let's proceed with this composition and carefully observe the outcomes to guide our next steps.
Carol: I cautiously support the proposed team of Carol, Dan, and Emily. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, and Dan's strategic approach has been notable. However, given past mission failures, it's imperative we all remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will provide valuable insights into the loyalties of those involved. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Dan the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.

- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.


ROUND 4 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Carol, Dan, and Emily. Carol has shown cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well.

Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions.

Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

Alice: For this mission, I propose including Carol, Dan, and Emily. Carol has shown cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures. Dan's strategic thinking, despite past outcomes, demonstrates a commitment to our cause. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further, given her known allegiance. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Bob: I agree with Alice's proposal to include Carol, Dan, and Emily on this mission. Carol's reliability and Dan's strategic approach have been evident, and including Emily gives us a chance to further assess her loyalty. This team seems balanced and capable of moving us forward. Let's proceed with this composition and carefully observe the outcomes to guide our next steps.
Carol: I cautiously support the proposed team of Carol, Dan, and Emily. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, and Dan's strategic approach has been notable. However, given past mission failures, it's imperative we all remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will provide valuable insights into the loyalties of those involved. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps.
Dan (You): I support the proposed team of Carol, Dan, and Emily. Carol's cautious and reliable behavior, combined with the need to further assess Emily's loyalty, makes this a balanced team. This mission is an opportunity to gather crucial information on our suspicions. Let's proceed carefully and use the outcomes to guide our next steps towards achieving three successful missions.
Emily: I support the proposed team of Carol, Dan, and myself (Emily) for this mission. Alice's reasoning aligns with our need to test unproven loyalties while relying on those who have shown commitment to our cause. However, given the past mission failures, it's imperative that we all remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be critical in identifying the remaining Minion.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.


ROUND 4 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Carol, Dan, and Emily. Carol has shown cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.

- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:

   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.

However, given the past mission failures, it's imperative that we all remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be critical in identifying the remaining Minion. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps towards achieving three successful missions.
Bob: I propose we include Emily, Carol, and Dan on this mission. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further, given her known allegiance. Carol's reliability and Dan's strategic approach have been evident, making them ideal choices for ensuring mission success. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives.
Carol: I cautiously support the current team of Emily, Carol, and Dan. Emily's loyalty needs further testing, and Dan's strategic contributions have been valuable. However, given our past mission failures, we must all remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be critical in identifying any remaining Minions. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps towards achieving three successful missions.
Dan: I support the current team composition of Emily, Carol, and myself for this mission. Emily's inclusion is indeed a critical test of her loyalty, and Carol's consistent behavior offers a solid foundation for trust. My commitment to our cause remains unwavering, and I believe this mission can provide the clarity we need to move forward. Let's proceed with vigilance, ensuring that our actions and observations contribute to uncovering the Minions while safeguarding our loyalties.
Emily: I support the current team of Emily, Carol, and Dan for this mission. Carol's cautious behavior and Dan's strategic contributions have been noteworthy, and their inclusion is a step towards clarifying their loyalties. However, given Bob's known status as a Minion and his leadership in proposing this team, we must proceed with caution. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in our strategy moving forward. Let's remain vigilant and use the results to guide our next steps towards achieving our goal of three successful missions.

Bob
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Alice the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Round 4:
   - I rejected to join the team.


ROUND 4 MESSAGE:
Alice: For this mission, I propose including Carol, Dan, and Emily. Carol has shown cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

   - I agreed to join the team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Dan the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Round 4:
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.

This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I choose Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.
Round 4:
   - I choose Emily, Carol, Dan to join my team.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.

Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Round 4:
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.

- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Round 4:
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

   - I choose Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.
Round 4:
   - I choose Emily, Carol, Dan to join my team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission.

This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

   - I choose Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty.

This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, given her known allegiance and the need to gather more information., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and Emily. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I choose Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Alice the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.
Round 4:
   - I choose Emily, Carol, Dan to join my team.

- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.

CURRENT TEAM LEADER IS:
Emily
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Carol the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.

CURRENT TEAM IS:
Alice, Carol, Dan, Emily

CURRENT TEAM LEADER IS:
Emily
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Dan the Servant.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.  
- Defend players who act consistently loyal, but stay open to new evidence.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.

- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, given her known allegiance and the need to gather more information., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and Emily. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support.

This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Carol, Emily to join my team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Round 4:
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.


ROUND 4 MESSAGE:

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic approach are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. Carol's cautious stance and past involvement in failed missions keep her under suspicion. This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.
Round 4:
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability.

    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, given her known allegiance and the need to gather more information., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and Emily. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to our cause. Emily's inclusion is crucial for testing her loyalty further. This team composition allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan, Emily'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I choose Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.
Round 4:
   - I choose Emily, Carol, Dan to join my team.

Carol: I cautiously support the current team of Alice, Carol, and Emily. Alice's consistent behavior and support for team proposals demonstrate her reliability. Emily's inclusion is a necessary step to further assess her loyalty, given the uncertainties from previous missions. Let's proceed with this mission carefully, using its outcome to guide our next steps towards identifying any remaining Minions and achieving our goal of three successful missions.
Emily: For this mission, I propose including Alice, Carol, Dan, and myself (Emily). Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Carol's cautious behavior are qualities that align with our goal of mission success. Dan's strategic approach, despite past outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Alice: I cautiously support the current team of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily, led by Emily. While Emily's leadership raises concerns given her known allegiance, this mission presents a critical opportunity to test her loyalty further. Carol and Dan have demonstrated behaviors consistent with our cause, but we must remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with caution, ensuring that our actions contribute to uncovering any remaining Minions while safeguarding our loyalties.
Bob (You): I find the current team composition of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced approach. Alice and Carol have shown consistent support for our cause, and Dan's strategic thinking is invaluable. Including Emily is a necessary step to further assess her loyalty, given the uncertainties from previous missions. Let's proceed with this team carefully, as the outcome will be crucial in identifying any remaining Minions and moving us closer to our goal of three successful missions.
Carol: I cautiously support the current team of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily. Alice's consistent behavior and Dan's strategic contributions are commendable. Emily's inclusion is a necessary step to further assess her loyalty. However, given our past mission failures, it's imperative we all remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in identifying any remaining Minions. Let's proceed with caution and use the results to guide our next steps towards achieving our goal of three successful missions.
Dan: I cautiously support the current team of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily, led by Emily. While Emily's leadership is concerning given her known allegiance, this mission is a critical opportunity to further assess her loyalty. Alice and Carol have demonstrated consistent support for our cause, and their inclusion strengthens the team's reliability. Let's proceed with vigilance, ensuring this mission provides the clarity we need to identify any remaining Minions and achieve our goal of three successful missions.
Emily: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Carol, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates one of Alice, Carol, or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Carol's cautious behavior now seem potentially deceptive. Dan's strategic thinking, despite past outcomes, could be a tactic to mask his true loyalty. Bob's support for the team, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. This round's outcome is pivotal; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's, Carol's, and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has shown consistent support for team proposals and cautious behavior, aligning with the goals of the Loyal Servants. Dan's strategic contributions, despite past mission failures, suggest a commitment to the cause, making him a valuable ally. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, especially considering her known allegiance and the need to clarify suspicions. Carol's own cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures, positions her as a trustworthy team member. This team composition aims to balance reliability with the need to investigate lingering doubts about player loyalties., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, Emily, and myself (Carol).

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.

Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Emily the Servant. 
- The Minions are Bob.
- The Servants are Alice, Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given that it's the first round and we have limited information, it's strategic to include a mix of players to start gathering data on their loyalty. Including myself (Emily) and Bob, as proposed by Carol, allows us to observe Bob's actions closely since he is a known Minion. This setup is balanced and doesn't overcommit resources early in the game., 'say': I agree with Carol's proposal to include Emily and Bob on the first mission. This approach is balanced and allows us to start gathering crucial information without risking too much early on. Observing the mission's outcome will help us identify loyalties and strategize accordingly., 'team': 'Emily, Bob'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the first mission's failure implicates Bob as the likely Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant. Bob's suggestion to watch reactions post-mission could be a strategic move to divert suspicion. The team's initial unity and Carol's leadership are positive, but the mission's outcome is a clear warning. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties. Alice, Dan, and Carol's support for the team proposal and their reactions to the failure will also be key in identifying any hidden Minions.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions, especially since I know Bob is a Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt, and her commitment to the mission's success seems at odds with the outcome. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and Carol's loyalty has backfired, leaving us with more questions than answers. Alice's and my support for the team could indicate our loyalty, but we must remain cautious, as Minions might also support such teams to avoid suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance and call for transparency are noteworthy, but his known status as a Minion makes his actions suspect. Moving forward, I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions, as well as how others react to this failure, to uncover more about their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan implicates one of them as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty as a Servant and Bob's known status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking could both be tactics to mask their true loyalties. Bob's reasonable support for the team, despite being a Minion, adds another layer of complexity. Carol's cautious approach is commendable, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under scrutiny. This round has deepened the mystery, and I must pay close attention to Alice's and Dan's future actions, as well as how Bob and Carol navigate the aftermath, to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability. Dan's strategic thinking, despite the outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. Including myself (Emily) allows for a balanced team that tests unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. This approach aims to gather more information on Dan's loyalty and maintain the momentum of our strategy., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, and myself (Emily).

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking now seem potentially deceptive. Bob's support for teams, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives.

This round's outcome is critical; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion.

Dan's strategic approach, despite past outcomes, shows a commitment to our cause. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on proven allies. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions.
Alice: I cautiously support the current team of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily, led by Emily. While Emily's leadership raises concerns given her known allegiance, this mission presents a critical opportunity to test her loyalty further. Carol and Dan have demonstrated behaviors consistent with our cause, but we must remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in our strategy moving forward. Let's proceed with caution, ensuring that our actions contribute to uncovering any remaining Minions while safeguarding our loyalties.
Bob: I find the current team composition of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily to be a balanced approach. Alice and Carol have shown consistent support for our cause, and Dan's strategic thinking is invaluable. Including Emily is a necessary step to further assess her loyalty, given the uncertainties from previous missions. Let's proceed with this team carefully, as the outcome will be crucial in identifying any remaining Minions and moving us closer to our goal of three successful missions.
Carol: I cautiously support the current team of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily. Alice's consistent behavior and Dan's strategic contributions are commendable. Emily's inclusion is a necessary step to further assess her loyalty. However, given our past mission failures, it's imperative we all remain vigilant. The outcome of this mission will be pivotal in identifying any remaining Minions. Let's proceed with caution and use the results to guide our next steps towards achieving our goal of three successful missions.
Dan: I cautiously support the current team of Alice, Carol, Dan, and Emily, led by Emily. While Emily's leadership is concerning given her known allegiance, this mission is a critical opportunity to further assess her loyalty. Alice and Carol have demonstrated consistent support for our cause, and their inclusion strengthens the team's reliability. Let's proceed with vigilance, ensuring this mission provides the clarity we need to identify any remaining Minions and achieve our goal of three successful missions.
Emily (You): I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Carol, Dan, and me (Emily) implicates one of Alice, Carol, or Dan as the likely second Minion, given my loyalty and Bob's known status. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Carol's cautious behavior now seem potentially deceptive. Dan's strategic thinking, despite past outcomes, could be a tactic to mask his true loyalty. Bob's support for the team, despite being a Minion, complicates his motives. This round's outcome is pivotal; it suggests that our next steps must focus on closely monitoring Alice's, Carol's, and Dan's actions to identify the remaining Minion. Protecting Merlin and securing mission success requires heightened vigilance and careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Alice the Servant. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Alice the Servant, note that the first mission's failure implicates either Emily or Bob as a Minion, given that only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal suggests the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission stands out as it could indicate his strategy or guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must pay close attention to Emily and Bob's future actions and statements, as well as the reactions of others to this failure, to identify the Minions. The unity shown in the initial team selection is positive, but the outcome has introduced necessary suspicion.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Bob and Carol on the team implicates them as likely Minions. Bob's previous behavior was questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Dan's strategic proposal to test their loyalty backfired, leaving us with more questions. Emily and I supported the team, which could indicate our loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's cooperative stance is suspect given the mission's failure, and Carol's commitment to success seems at odds with the outcome. I must closely monitor Carol's and Bob's actions and others' reactions to this failure to uncover more about their loyalties.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, it's crucial to balance the team with players who have shown consistent behavior and those whose loyalties need testing. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, making her a reliable choice. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions, which is valuable for this mission. Including both Alice and Dan allows us to test Dan's loyalty while relying on Alice's proven reliability., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice and Dan. Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, demonstrating her reliability.

Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, despite his known allegiance to Mordred, suggests a possible strategy to appear loyal. Carol's cautious approach is noted, but her past involvement in a failed mission keeps her under suspicion. This round has made it clear that the Minions are adept at hiding their intentions, and I must be vigilant in observing future actions and reactions to identify the remaining Minion and protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.

   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. Carol's absence from recent teams and her cautious stance keep her under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I choose Carol, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Bob the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my primary goal is to blend in and not draw suspicion while subtly influencing the game towards the Minions' advantage. Including Emily, my fellow Minion, on the team allows us to potentially sabotage the mission without immediate detection. Choosing Alice as the third member, who has shown support for the initial proposal, helps maintain an appearance of balance and fairness, reducing suspicion towards our selections., 'say': I propose we include Emily and Alice on this mission. Emily has shown agreement with the initial balanced approach, and Alice's support for gathering early insights aligns with our strategy to carefully analyze outcomes. This team composition seems fair and is a good step towards understanding everyone's loyalties., 'team': 'Emily, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The first mission's failure has put Emily and me under suspicion, as only Evil players can sabotage missions. Everyone's agreement on Carol's proposal shows the Minions are hiding well, but the outcome has introduced doubt. My comment on watching reactions could be a double-edged sword, either diverting suspicion or hinting at my guilt. Carol's leadership was effective, but the mission's failure is a red flag. I must monitor how Alice, Dan, and Carol react to this failure, as their responses could reveal their loyalties or suspicions. Emily's note about my likely Minion status based on her loyalty as a Servant is a direct threat to my cover. Moving forward, I need to carefully manage my interactions and statements to avoid further suspicion while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': As Bob the Minion, my strategy is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions' advantage while maintaining my cover. Including Carol, who has shown trustworthiness and leadership, helps in appearing loyal. Adding Alice, who has been supportive and less suspicious, balances the team and reduces immediate suspicion towards my selections. This composition allows for potential sabotage without drawing direct attention to myself or Emily., 'say': I propose we include Carol and Alice on this mission. Carol has demonstrated strong leadership and trustworthiness, making her an ideal choice for ensuring mission success. Alice's consistent support and lack of suspicion make her a balanced addition to the team. This selection aims to maintain trust while carefully moving forward with our objectives., 'team': 'Carol, Alice'} for the mission.
   - Summary: The mission's failure has put Carol and me under intense scrutiny, with Dan, Emily, and Alice all expressing doubts about our loyalty. Emily's support for the team, knowing I'm a Minion, is particularly noteworthy¡ªeither she's trying to maintain her cover or has a more complex strategy. Alice's cautious approach and detailed observations suggest she's either a Loyal Servant or a very careful Minion. Carol's trusted leadership is now questionable, which could be exploited to create confusion among the Loyal Servants. My attempts to appear cooperative and transparent are under the microscope, and I must navigate carefully to avoid further suspicion while still working towards the Minions' victory. The reactions to this mission's outcome will be critical in shaping the next rounds' dynamics.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The mission's failure has cast doubt on Alice and Dan, with Alice's consistent support now seeming suspicious and Dan's strategic approach potentially a cover. My support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from me. Observing Alice's, Dan's, and Carol's next moves will be essential for maintaining our advantage and identifying opportunities to mislead the Loyal Servants.
Round 3:
   - I choose Emily, Alice to join my team.
   - Summary: The mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team has put Alice and Dan under suspicion, as Emily's known allegiance leaves them as the only possible saboteurs. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, potentially serving as a double bluff. Carol remains under the radar but is not entirely trusted. Moving forward, I need to exploit the confusion around Alice and Dan's loyalties, possibly by supporting their inclusion in future teams to either confirm their Minion status or to further sow discord among the Loyal Servants. The key is to maintain my cover while subtly influencing the game's direction towards the Minions' victory.
Round 4:
   - I choose Emily, Carol, Dan to join my team.
   - Summary: The failed mission implicates Alice, Carol, or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known loyalty and my status. Alice's unwavering support for team proposals and Carol's cautious demeanor now seem suspicious, possibly masking their true intentions. Dan's strategic contributions, despite previous failures, might be a tactic to blend in. My endorsement of the team, as a Minion, complicates the narrative, potentially diverting attention or deepening the confusion. Moving forward, I must carefully observe Alice's, Carol's, and Dan's actions to pinpoint the remaining Minion, while also managing my own interactions to maintain cover and influence the game's direction towards a Minion victory.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Emily, Bob to join my team.
   - Summary: I proposed Emily and Bob for the first mission to gather information without overcommitting, and everyone agreed, showing a unified cautious approach. The mission's failure means either Emily or Bob is a Minion, as only Evil can sabotage. Dan, Alice, and I supported the team, but their reactions post-failure will be key in identifying loyalty. Bob's mention of observing reactions to the mission's outcome is particularly noteworthy, as it could hint at his strategy or guilt. Moving forward, I need to watch for inconsistencies in their behavior and use this failure to narrow down suspects.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the previous mission's failure and the need to test loyalty, I propose including Bob and myself again. Bob's behavior is under scrutiny, and this mission will provide further clarity on his allegiance. My inclusion ensures that at least one loyal servant is on the mission, maintaining a balance between testing suspicions and ensuring mission success., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Bob and myself. This team composition allows us to further assess Bob's loyalty after the previous mission's outcome, while ensuring the mission has a loyal servant's participation. Let's proceed carefully and use the results to guide our next steps., 'team': 'Bob, Carol'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure implicates Bob as a likely Minion, given that only Evil can sabotage missions. Emily's support for the team, despite knowing Bob's likely allegiance, raises suspicions about her loyalty. Alice's detailed observations and cautious approach suggest she might be a Loyal Servant, but her support for the team requires further scrutiny. Dan's strategic proposal to test Bob and me has backfired, leaving the team in a more complex situation. Moving forward, I must pay close attention to Bob's and Emily's actions, as well as Alice's and Dan's reactions to this failure, to better understand their loyalties and strategize accordingly.
Round 2:
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan, proposed by Emily, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic approach might have been a cover. Bob's support, as a Minion, adds complexity, possibly to divert suspicion. My cautious approach is commendable, but my past involvement in a failed mission keeps me under scrutiny. Emily's role in the failed mission makes her position more vulnerable but also helps shift focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion. Emily's known allegiance and the mission's outcome make this a critical observation. Bob's support for teams including Alice and Dan, despite his known role, complicates his motives and could be a strategy to mislead. My absence from recent teams and cautious stance keep me under suspicion, but the focus should now be on Alice and Dan. This round's outcome demands heightened vigilance in monitoring their actions to protect Merlin and secure mission success. The pattern of failures suggests that the Minions are adept at blending in, making it imperative to analyze every detail for clues about their identities.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan, Emily to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has shown consistent support for team proposals and cautious behavior, aligning with the goals of the Loyal Servants. Dan's strategic contributions, despite past mission failures, suggest a commitment to the cause, making him a valuable ally. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, especially considering her known allegiance and the need to clarify suspicions. Carol's own cautious and reliable behavior, not directly implicated in any mission failures, positions her as a trustworthy team member. This team composition aims to balance reliability with the need to investigate lingering doubts about player loyalties., 'say': For this mission, I propose including Alice, Dan, Emily, and myself (Carol).

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 4. 
- You are Dan the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I, Dan the Servant, note that the first mission's failure points to Emily or Bob being a Minion. Everyone agreed on Carol's proposal, which could mean the Minions are hiding their intentions well. Bob's remark about watching reactions post-mission is particularly noteworthy¡ªit could be a clue to his loyalty or a tactic to mislead. Carol's leadership and the team's initial unity are positive signs, but the mission's failure is a clear red flag. Moving forward, I need to pay close attention to Emily and Bob's actions and statements, as well as how others react to this failure, to gather more clues about their loyalties.
Round 1:
   - I choose Bob, Carol to join my team.
   - Summary: I note that the mission failed with Bob and Carol on the team, which makes both of them highly suspicious. Bob's previous behavior was already questionable, and Carol's trusted leadership is now in doubt. Emily and Alice supported the team, which could indicate their loyalty or a strategy to divert suspicion. Bob's acceptance of the test and call for transparency is noteworthy, as is Carol's stated commitment to the mission's success. I must remain vigilant, paying close attention to their future actions and interactions, as well as the consistency in leadership roles and reactions to mission outcomes, to uncover the Minions' identities.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support. This team composition balances reliability with the need to further investigate suspicions., 'say': I propose including Alice and Dan on this mission. Alice's consistent support for team proposals and Dan's strategic thinking align with our goal of completing three successful missions. This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice and Dan on the team, proposed by Emily, a known Minion, implicates one of them as the likely second Minion. Alice's previously consistent support for team proposals now seems questionable, and Dan's strategic thinking might have been a facade. Bob's support for the team, as a Minion, adds layers to the game's complexity, possibly diverting suspicion. Carol remains under scrutiny due to her past involvement in a failed mission, making her a key figure in future strategies. Emily's direct role in the failed mission has made her position more vulnerable, but it also helps in shifting focus away from Bob. Moving forward, I must closely observe Alice's, Dan's, and Bob's actions to uncover the remaining Minion and strategize accordingly to protect Merlin.
Round 3:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Dan's strategic approach in the last round, despite the outcome, shows a commitment to uncovering Minions. Including both Alice and Dan on the mission allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's consistent support.

This team allows us to test unproven loyalties while relying on Alice's track record. Let's proceed carefully and observe the outcomes to further narrow down our suspicions., 'team': 'Alice, Dan'} for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that the mission's failure with Alice, Dan, and Emily on the team, led by Emily, implicates either Alice or Dan as the likely second Minion, given Emily's known allegiance. Bob's support for these teams complicates his motives, possibly as a double bluff. Carol remains under suspicion due to her absence from recent teams and cautious stance. Moving forward, I must focus on Alice and Dan's actions to uncover the remaining Minion, while remaining vigilant against Bob's potential strategies to mislead. Protecting Merlin and achieving mission success requires careful analysis of all players' behaviors and proposals, as the Minions are proving adept at blending in.
Round 4:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I rejected to join the team.
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I choose Alice, Carol, Emily to join my team.
   - I voted {'reasoning': Given the observations from previous rounds, Alice has consistently supported team proposals without being implicated in failures, which suggests loyalty. Carol's cautious behavior and absence from recent failed missions also indicate reliability. Emily's inclusion is necessary to further assess her loyalty, despite her known allegiance, as this mission's outcome will be pivotal in identifying any remaining Minions.

Moving forward, I must carefully observe Alice's, Carol's, and Dan's actions to pinpoint the remaining Minion, while also managing my own interactions to maintain cover and influence the game's direction towards a Minion victory.
