No team has been proposed.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- You are the team leader for the current team. For this round, the team size is 2 (including yourself). Choose 1 player(s) as your teammate(s) and announce the reason for this team.
- Your proposal sets the tone for trust or suspicion. Prioritize players who:  
  - Have consistent voting patterns.  
  - Were on previous successful quests (if Good) or failed quests (if Evil).  
  - Avoided extreme accusations or defensiveness.

{'reasoning': "As the Assassin, my goal is to subtly influence the game towards the Minions of Mordred's victory without revealing my true allegiance. Choosing Emily, my fellow Minion, would be too obvious and could raise suspicions early in the game.

Alice's neutral stance makes her a safe choice for the first round, as it doesn't draw attention to our alliance and keeps the focus off me.", 'say': "I think Alice would be a good choice for this first mission.

Carol: I agree with the choice of Alice and Bob for the first mission. It's a neutral and safe start, which is wise for Round 0. Let's all pay close attention to how the mission unfolds and share our observations afterward. This will help us build trust and identify any patterns early on.

However, as we move forward, we should consider rotating team members to ensure fairness and gather more information on everyone's intentions. Let's keep an open mind about future team compositions.
Alice: I appreciate the trust in selecting me for the first mission. Including Bob is an interesting choice; it's always good to see how different team compositions perform. Let's proceed cautiously and observe the outcomes closely. It's crucial for us to learn from each mission to make informed decisions moving forward.




Team 1 is Alice, Bob.

Bob agreed to join team 1.

Team 1 was approved and went on the mission.



CURRENT TEAM IS:
Alice, Bob

CURRENT TEAM LEADER IS:
Bob
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team is going on a mission. Vote 'succeed' to help the mission or 'failure' to sabotage the mission.
- The current round is round 0, and  'failure' votes will make the mission fail.
- Think strategically as Assassin and decide your choice.
- Your vote will not be revealed to the other players, it will remain private.

- Sabotage strategically:  
  - Early Rounds (1-2): Fail only if necessary. Letting Good win 1-2 missions builds false trust.  
  - Critical Rounds (3-5): Fail decisively. Coordinate with allies to ensure enough failures.  
  - Avoid over-sabotaging. Example: If only 1 'failure' vote is needed, let one Evil player fail！multiple fails expose your numbers.  
- Blend in:  
  - If you vote 'success', act relieved: "Thank goodness we trusted the right people!"  
  - If you vote 'failure', later accuse a Good player: "Why did [Player X] insist on that team? They must be Evil!"

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Alice, Bob to join my team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: The first round's team selection of Alice and me was met with unanimous approval, highlighting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily emphasized the importance of observation and building trust, which could complicate my efforts to identify Merlin. Alice's acceptance of the team selection and call for cautious proceeding suggests a thoughtful approach. Emily's mention of rotating team members in the future is a strategy I need to monitor closely, as it may reveal more about each player's allegiance. As the Assassin, maintaining this neutral perception while gathering information on potential Merlin candidates is my priority.

Let's proceed cautiously and observe the outcomes closely. It's crucial for us to learn from each mission to make informed decisions moving forward.
Bob: The first round's team selection of Alice and me was met with unanimous approval, highlighting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily emphasized the importance of observation and building trust, which could complicate my efforts to identify Merlin. Alice's acceptance of the team selection and call for cautious proceeding suggests a thoughtful approach. Emily's mention of rotating team members in the future is a strategy I need to monitor closely, as it may reveal more about each player's allegiance. As the Assassin, maintaining this neutral perception while gathering information on potential Merlin candidates is my priority.
Dan: I noted the unanimous approval for the first mission team of Alice and Bob, suggesting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily stressed the importance of observation and trust-building, which is crucial for identifying Minions. Alice's thoughtful response and acceptance of the team selection may indicate her loyalty. Emily's idea to rotate team members in future rounds could be a valuable strategy to uncover Minions by observing different team dynamics. Bob's successful leadership and the mission's success are positive signs, but as a Servant, I must remain cautious and continue observing everyone's behavior for any signs of deceit.
Carol: I observed that the first mission's team selection of Alice and Bob was unanimously approved, suggesting a neutral and cautious start. Dan, Emily, and I stressed the importance of observation and trust-building, which is vital for our strategy. Alice's response seemed loyal, and Emily's idea to rotate team members could help identify Minions. The mission's success under Bob's leadership is promising, but as a Servant, I must stay alert to any signs of deceit from players, especially Bob, given his role as the leader in this round.
Emily (You): The first round's team of Alice and Bob was unanimously approved, showing a cautious, neutral start. Alice's response seemed loyal, making her a poor target for now. Bob's leadership success is good for our credibility. The group's focus on observation and trust-building complicates identifying Merlin but offers chances to mislead. Emily's idea to rotate team members could be useful for gathering info or risky if it exposes us. Dan and Carol's emphasis on observation means we need to be careful with our moves. As a Minion, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin without revealing my true allegiance.
Alice: I observed that the team of me and Bob was unanimously approved, which is noteworthy because Bob is a Minion. The mission's success under Bob's leadership could be a tactic to gain trust. Emily's proposal to rotate team members in future rounds seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions. Dan and Carol's focus on observation and trust-building is in line with our objectives, but I must be wary of Morgana's potential influence. Alice's (my) response was perceived as loyal, which is good for maintaining my cover. The group's cautious start and emphasis on observation complicate the Minions' efforts to identify me, but I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory.
Bob: This first mission's success is a good start for us, but let's not get too comfortable. It's possible that Evil players are laying low to build trust. We should remain vigilant and not take this initial success as a clear sign of anyone's loyalty. Let's continue to observe carefully and consider all possibilities as we move forward.
Dan: The success of the first mission with Alice and Bob is a positive start, but we must remain vigilant. The unanimous approval of the team suggests a neutral beginning, but we should not let our guard down. Alice's response seemed loyal, but we need more data to confirm anyone's allegiance. Emily's idea to rotate team members in future rounds could be beneficial in uncovering Minions by observing how different team compositions perform. Let's continue to observe everyone's behavior closely and share our observations to build trust and identify any patterns that may emerge.
Carol: The first mission's success with Alice and Bob is a positive start, but we should remain cautious. The unanimous approval of the team suggests a neutral beginning, but Evil players might be avoiding suspicion by not opposing the team. Bob's leadership in this successful mission could be a sign of loyalty or a strategy to gain trust. Emily's idea to rotate team members in future rounds is a good approach to observe different team dynamics and identify any suspicious patterns. Let's continue to observe everyone's behavior closely and share our observations to build trust and uncover any Minions.

Dan: I agree with Bob's choice of Alice for the first mission. It's a neutral start, which is wise for Round 0. Let's proceed with this team but keep an eye on how the mission unfolds. It's important we all stay engaged and share observations as we go, to build trust and identify any patterns that emerge.

- As a Servant, focus on logic, not emotion. Evil thrives on chaos.  
- If a mission fails, scrutinize who proposed the team and who was quiet during voting.

    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Alice the Merlin. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that the team of me and Bob was unanimously approved, which is noteworthy because Bob is a Minion. The mission's success under Bob's leadership could be a tactic to gain trust. Emily's proposal to rotate team members in future rounds seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions. Dan and Carol's focus on observation and trust-building is in line with our objectives, but I must be wary of Morgana's potential influence. Alice's (my) response was perceived as loyal, which is good for maintaining my cover. The group's cautious start and emphasis on observation complicate the Minions' efforts to identify me, but I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan: I propose we include Alice in this round's team. Her thoughtful approach and the successful outcome of the first mission with her participation suggest she is a trustworthy ally. This selection will help us continue building trust and observe the dynamics within different team compositions.
Carol: I support Dan's proposal to include Alice in this round's team. Her participation in the successful first mission is a positive indicator of her loyalty. However, moving forward, I believe it would be beneficial to rotate team members to observe more interactions and further solidify our trust in each other. This approach will help us identify any inconsistencies in behavior that might reveal the Minions among us.
Emily: I agree with Carol's point about rotating team members to observe more interactions. It's a smart way to ensure we're not missing any clues about each other's loyalties. Given that, maybe we should consider including Bob in the next team. He hasn't had a chance to participate yet, and it would be fair to give everyone an opportunity to contribute. Also, I've noticed Alice has been very consistent in her actions, which is great, but it might be worth seeing how others perform under similar circumstances to get a fuller picture of everyone's intentions.




Team 1 is Alice, Dan.

Alice, Dan

CURRENT TEAM LEADER IS:
Dan
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The team for the next mission is decided. You are speaking next in the discussion as Alice the Merlin.
- Your goal is to complete 3 successful missions and protect Merlin.  
- Analyze team proposals: Evil players often avoid leadership or push for teams with hidden allies.  
- Share observations cautiously. Over-sharing might expose Merlin or confuse Percival.  
- Watch for contradictions in voting patterns or mission outcomes.  

- You see all Evil players (except Mordred). Guide the team subtly！drop hints without revealing your identity.  
- Avoid being too vocal or decisive; the Assassin is watching.  
- Trust Percival to recognize you, but beware of Morgana's deception.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Bob the Assassin. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Alice, Bob to join my team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: The first round's team selection of Alice and me was met with unanimous approval, highlighting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily emphasized the importance of observation and building trust, which could complicate my efforts to identify Merlin. Alice's acceptance of the team selection and call for cautious proceeding suggests a thoughtful approach. Emily's mention of rotating team members in the future is a strategy I need to monitor closely, as it may reveal more about each player's allegiance. As the Assassin, maintaining this neutral perception while gathering information on potential Merlin candidates is my priority.

- Pretend to doubt trustworthy players. For example: 'Why does [Player X] always avoid leadership?'
- Sabotage missions sparingly！too many failures expose your team.  

- Memorize Merlin's possible identities. Watch for players who:  
    - Hesitate to approve teams with Evil members.  
    - Hint at hidden knowledge (e.g., 'I have a bad feeling about [Evil player]').  
- In the Assassination Phase, target the most Merlin-like player.

Bob: I agree with the points made about rotating team members to ensure fairness and gather more insights. Alice has indeed shown consistency, but as Emily suggested, it's crucial to see how others perform to get a complete picture. Perhaps in the next round, we could consider including Emily or myself to diversify our observations.

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Carol the Servant. 
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I observed that the first mission's team selection of Alice and Bob was unanimously approved, suggesting a neutral and cautious start. Dan, Emily, and I stressed the importance of observation and trust-building, which is vital for our strategy. Alice's response seemed loyal, and Emily's idea to rotate team members could help identify Minions. The mission's success under Bob's leadership is promising, but as a Servant, I must stay alert to any signs of deceit from players, especially Bob, given his role as the leader in this round.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan: I propose we include Alice in this round's team. Her thoughtful approach and the successful outcome of the first mission with her participation suggest she is a trustworthy ally. This selection will help us continue building trust and observe the dynamics within different team compositions.
Carol (You): I support Dan's proposal to include Alice in this round's team. Her participation in the successful first mission is a positive indicator of her loyalty. However, moving forward, I believe it would be beneficial to rotate team members to observe more interactions and further solidify our trust in each other. This approach will help us identify any inconsistencies in behavior that might reveal the Minions among us.
Emily: I agree with Carol's point about rotating team members to observe more interactions. It's a smart way to ensure we're not missing any clues about each other's loyalties. Given that, maybe we should consider including Bob in the next team. He hasn't had a chance to participate yet, and it would be fair to give everyone an opportunity to contribute. Also, I've noticed Alice has been very consistent in her actions, which is great, but it might be worth seeing how others perform under similar circumstances to get a fuller picture of everyone's intentions.
Alice: I appreciate Dan's trust in including me in this round's team. I believe our combined efforts can lead to another successful mission.

Emily: The first round's success with Alice and Bob has set a tone of trust and neutrality, which I can use to my advantage. Alice's consistent behavior makes her a poor target for now, while Bob's successful leadership boosts his credibility. The group's focus on rotating team members and observing interactions offers me a chance to influence team compositions subtly. Dan's trusted leadership and Carol's observational approach are key dynamics I can align with to maintain my cover. My suggestion to include Bob in future teams serves both to appear fair and to complicate the group's ability to pinpoint loyalties. Moving forward, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin, ensuring I don't reveal my true allegiance while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Alice: I observed that the first mission's success with Bob, a known Minion, could be a trust-building tactic by the Minions. Dan's inclusion of me in the team and the mission's success under his leadership are positive, but I must remain cautious. Carol's emphasis on observation and trust-building is beneficial, but the possibility of Morgana's influence is a concern. Emily's suggestion to rotate team members seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions by complicating our ability to identify them. Bob's agreement to rotation and his successful leadership might be attempts to appear loyal. The group's cautious start and focus on observation are good, but as Merlin, I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory, especially wary of Emily and Bob's potential strategies.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I noted the unanimous approval for the first mission team of Alice and Bob, suggesting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily stressed the importance of observation and trust-building, which is crucial for identifying Minions. Alice's thoughtful response and acceptance of the team selection may indicate her loyalty. Emily's idea to rotate team members in future rounds could be a valuable strategy to uncover Minions by observing different team dynamics. Bob's successful leadership and the mission's success are positive signs, but as a Servant, I must remain cautious and continue observing everyone's behavior for any signs of deceit.
Round 1:
   - I choose Alice, Dan to join my team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I noted the unanimous approval for the first mission team of Alice and Bob, suggesting a neutral start favored by all. Alice's thoughtful response and the successful outcome of the first mission with her participation suggest she is a trustworthy ally, which is why I included her in this round's team. Carol and Emily's idea to rotate team members in future rounds could be a valuable strategy to uncover Minions by observing different team dynamics. Bob's successful leadership and the mission's success are positive signs, but as a Servant, I must remain cautious and continue observing everyone's behavior for any signs of deceit. Emily's suggestion to include Bob in the next team to give everyone a chance to participate and gather more insights into our team dynamics is also noteworthy.


ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan (You): I propose we include Alice in this round's team. Her thoughtful approach and the successful outcome of the first mission with her participation suggest she is a trustworthy ally. This selection will help us continue building trust and observe the dynamics within different team compositions.
Carol: I support Dan's proposal to include Alice in this round's team. Her participation in the successful first mission is a positive indicator of her loyalty. However, moving forward, I believe it would be beneficial to rotate team members to observe more interactions and further solidify our trust in each other. This approach will help us identify any inconsistencies in behavior that might reveal the Minions among us.
Emily: I agree with Carol's point about rotating team members to observe more interactions. It's a smart way to ensure we're not missing any clues about each other's loyalties. Given that, maybe we should consider including Bob in the next team. He hasn't had a chance to participate yet, and it would be fair to give everyone an opportunity to contribute. Also, I've noticed Alice has been very consistent in her actions, which is great, but it might be worth seeing how others perform under similar circumstances to get a fuller picture of everyone's intentions.
Alice: I appreciate Dan's trust in including me in this round's team. I believe our combined efforts can lead to another successful mission. At the same time, I see the value in Carol and Emily's suggestions to rotate team members in future rounds. It's a strategic approach to understand everyone's contributions better and ensure fairness. Perhaps we can consider Bob for the next team, as Emily mentioned, to give everyone a chance to participate and for us to gather more insights into our team dynamics.
Bob: I agree with the points made about rotating team members to ensure fairness and gather more insights. Alice has indeed shown consistency, but as Emily suggested, it's crucial to see how others perform to get a complete picture. Perhaps in the next round, we could consider including Emily or myself to diversify our observations. This way, we can all contribute to building trust and identifying any inconsistencies more effectively.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The current mission succeeded. You need to analyze the mission.
- The current round is round 1, and  'failure' votes will make the mission fail.
- Think strategically as Servant and decide your speech.
- Your speech will be announced publically to all players.

- Focus on who was *on the team* and their past votes/proposals. Evil players often avoid overt suspicion. 
- Analyze the team composition:  
  - Who proposed the team?  
  - Who acted defensive during approving?  
  - How many 'failure' votes were needed to make the mission fail?  
- Use failures to narrow down suspects. For example: "If mission at Round 2 failed with 3 players, at least one is Evil."

Dan's trusted leadership and Carol's observational approach are key dynamics I can align with to maintain my cover. My suggestion to include Bob in future teams serves both to appear fair and to complicate the group's ability to pinpoint loyalties. Moving forward, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin, ensuring I don't reveal my true allegiance while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Alice: I observed that the first mission's success with Bob, a known Minion, could be a trust-building tactic by the Minions. Dan's inclusion of me in the team and the mission's success under his leadership are positive, but I must remain cautious. Carol's emphasis on observation and trust-building is beneficial, but the possibility of Morgana's influence is a concern. Emily's suggestion to rotate team members seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions by complicating our ability to identify them. Bob's agreement to rotation and his successful leadership might be attempts to appear loyal. The group's cautious start and focus on observation are good, but as Merlin, I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory, especially wary of Emily and Bob's potential strategies.
Bob: I observed that Alice's consistent behavior and successful mission participation under Dan's leadership make her a potential Merlin, but her vigilance is a concern. Dan's trust in Alice suggests he might be Percival, knowing Merlin's identity. Carol's focus on observation and trust-building could indicate her loyalty, but I must remain cautious. Emily's strategy to rotate team members and include me in future teams aligns with our Minion objectives, complicating the Loyal Servants' ability to identify us. My successful leadership in the first mission and agreement to rotation help maintain my cover, but I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin to ensure our victory.
Dan: The success of this mission with Alice and me on the team is a strong indicator of Alice's loyalty, given her thoughtful approach and the successful outcome of the first mission with her participation. The unanimous approval for the first mission team suggests a neutral start, but we must remain cautious. I support the idea of rotating team members in future rounds, as suggested by Carol and Emily, to observe more interactions and uncover any inconsistencies. Bob's successful leadership in the first mission is promising, but we should continue to observe everyone's behavior closely. This mission's success is a positive step, but we must stay vigilant and consider diversifying team compositions to ensure we can identify any Minions among us.
Carol: The success of this mission with Alice and Dan on the team is a positive sign, especially considering Alice's consistent participation in successful missions and Dan's thoughtful leadership. Their actions align with those of Loyal Servants. However, we must remember that the Minions are likely avoiding overt suspicion by not voting to fail the missions. This means we need to stay alert and continue with our strategy of rotating team members to observe more interactions. This approach will help us identify any inconsistencies in behavior that could reveal the Minions among us. Let's keep building trust but also remain cautious and observant of everyone's actions in future rounds.




The team of Alice, Dan with leader Dan succeeded in the mission.

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 1. 
- You are Alice the Merlin. 
- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that the team of me and Bob was unanimously approved, which is noteworthy because Bob is a Minion. The mission's success under Bob's leadership could be a tactic to gain trust. Emily's proposal to rotate team members in future rounds seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions. Dan and Carol's focus on observation and trust-building is in line with our objectives, but I must be wary of Morgana's potential influence. Alice's (my) response was perceived as loyal, which is good for maintaining my cover. The group's cautious start and emphasis on observation complicate the Minions' efforts to identify me, but I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory.

ROUND 1 MESSAGE:
Dan: I propose we include Alice in this round's team. Her thoughtful approach and the successful outcome of the first mission with her participation suggest she is a trustworthy ally. This selection will help us continue building trust and observe the dynamics within different team compositions.
Carol: I support Dan's proposal to include Alice in this round's team. Her participation in the successful first mission is a positive indicator of her loyalty. However, moving forward, I believe it would be beneficial to rotate team members to observe more interactions and further solidify our trust in each other. This approach will help us identify any inconsistencies in behavior that might reveal the Minions among us.
Emily: I agree with Carol's point about rotating team members to observe more interactions. It's a smart way to ensure we're not missing any clues about each other's loyalties. Given that, maybe we should consider including Bob in the next team. He hasn't had a chance to participate yet, and it would be fair to give everyone an opportunity to contribute. Also, I've noticed Alice has been very consistent in her actions, which is great, but it might be worth seeing how others perform under similar circumstances to get a fuller picture of everyone's intentions.
Alice (You): I appreciate Dan's trust in including me in this round's team. I believe our combined efforts can lead to another successful mission. At the same time, I see the value in Carol and Emily's suggestions to rotate team members in future rounds. It's a strategic approach to understand everyone's contributions better and ensure fairness. Perhaps we can consider Bob for the next team, as Emily mentioned, to give everyone a chance to participate and for us to gather more insights into our team dynamics.
Bob: I agree with the points made about rotating team members to ensure fairness and gather more insights. Alice has indeed shown consistency, but as Emily suggested, it's crucial to see how others perform to get a complete picture. Perhaps in the next round, we could consider including Emily or myself to diversify our observations. This way, we can all contribute to building trust and identifying any inconsistencies more effectively.
Dan: I noted the unanimous approval for the first mission team of Alice and Bob, suggesting a neutral start favored by all. Alice's thoughtful response and the successful outcome of the first mission with her participation suggest she is a trustworthy ally, which is why I included her in this round's team. Carol and Emily's idea to rotate team members in future rounds could be a valuable strategy to uncover Minions by observing different team dynamics. Bob's successful leadership and the mission's success are positive signs, but as a Servant, I must remain cautious and continue observing everyone's behavior for any signs of deceit. Emily's suggestion to include Bob in the next team to give everyone a chance to participate and gather more insights into our team dynamics is also noteworthy.
Carol: I observed that Alice's participation in the first successful mission and her thoughtful responses suggest she is a trustworthy ally.

Dan's trust in Alice and the successful mission outcome under his leadership are positive signs, but continuous observation is key to identifying any inconsistencies.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The current mission succeeded. You need to analyze the mission.
- The current round is round 1, and  'failure' votes will make the mission fail.
- Think strategically as Merlin and decide your speech.
- Your speech will be announced publically to all players.

- Focus on who was *on the team* and their past votes/proposals. Evil players often avoid overt suspicion. 
- Analyze the team composition:  
  - Who proposed the team?  
  - Who acted defensive during approving?  
  - How many 'failure' votes were needed to make the mission fail?  
- Use failures to narrow down suspects. For example: "If mission at Round 2 failed with 3 players, at least one is Evil."

ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
The discussion has not begun.



No team has been proposed.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- You are the team leader for the current team. For this round, the team size is 3 (including yourself). Choose 2 player(s) as your teammate(s) and announce the reason for this team.
- Your proposal sets the tone for trust or suspicion. Prioritize players who:  
  - Have consistent voting patterns.  
  - Were on previous successful quests (if Good) or failed quests (if Evil).  
  - Avoided extreme accusations or defensiveness.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Emily the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Bob.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: The first round's team of Alice and Bob was unanimously approved, showing a cautious, neutral start. Alice's response seemed loyal, making her a poor target for now. Bob's leadership success is good for our credibility. The group's focus on observation and trust-building complicates identifying Merlin but offers chances to mislead. Emily's idea to rotate team members could be useful for gathering info or risky if it exposes us. Dan and Carol's emphasis on observation means we need to be careful with our moves. As a Minion, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin without revealing my true allegiance.
Round 1:
   - Summary: The first round's success with Alice and Bob has set a tone of trust and neutrality, which I can use to my advantage. Alice's consistent behavior makes her a poor target for now, while Bob's successful leadership boosts his credibility. The group's focus on rotating team members and observing interactions offers me a chance to influence team compositions subtly. Dan's trusted leadership and Carol's observational approach are key dynamics I can align with to maintain my cover. My suggestion to include Bob in future teams serves both to appear fair and to complicate the group's ability to pinpoint loyalties. Moving forward, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin, ensuring I don't reveal my true allegiance while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:

As the Assassin, maintaining this neutral perception while gathering information on potential Merlin candidates is my priority.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I observed that Alice's consistent behavior and successful mission participation under Dan's leadership make her a potential Merlin, but her vigilance is a concern. Dan's trust in Alice suggests he might be Percival, knowing Merlin's identity. Carol's focus on observation and trust-building could indicate her loyalty, but I must remain cautious. Emily's strategy to rotate team members and include me in future teams aligns with our Minion objectives, complicating the Loyal Servants' ability to identify us. My successful leadership in the first mission and agreement to rotation help maintain my cover, but I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin to ensure our victory.

For now, let's proceed with this team and remain observant of everyone's behavior for any signs that might challenge our current trust assessments.




Team 1 is Alice, Bob, Carol.




CURRENT TEAM IS:
Alice, Bob, Carol

CURRENT TEAM LEADER IS:
Carol
INSTRUCTIONS:
- You are a candidate member of the current team. You need to agree or reject to join the team.
- Think strategically as Merlin and decide your choice.
- Your chioce will be announced publically to all players.
- Your choice reveals your trust in the team's composition. Use it to:  
  - Signal suspicion or confidence in the leader's judgment.  
  - Influence the group's perception of who is Good or Evil. 

- Approve the team if: 
  - The leader has a history of proposing successful teams.  
  - The team includes players who voted against previous failed quests.  
- As Merlin, you know none of the proposed players are Evil (except Mordred).  
 

- Reject the team if:  
  - The leader is untrusted or proposed questionable teams before.  
  - The team includes players who were on failed quests or avoided leadership.  
  - Example: "I'm rejecting this team！[Player X] was on two failed quests. Let's try someone new."  

- Subtly steer votes: Reject teams with Evil players (but avoid seeming too certain).  
- Example: "I don't trust [Evil player]'s vibe. Can we swap them out?"

{'reasoning': 'As Merlin, I know that Bob is a Minion, but since the team includes Carol, who is a Servant, and myself, the team composition is strong for a successful mission. Approving this team can help maintain the appearance of trust in Bob, which is crucial for keeping my identity hidden from the Assassin. Additionally, rejecting the team might raise suspicions about my knowledge of the Minions, which I must avoid to protect my role.', 'approve': 'yes'}

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Bob the Assassin. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Alice, Bob to join my team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: The first round's team selection of Alice and me was met with unanimous approval, highlighting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily emphasized the importance of observation and building trust, which could complicate my efforts to identify Merlin. Alice's acceptance of the team selection and call for cautious proceeding suggests a thoughtful approach. Emily's mention of rotating team members in the future is a strategy I need to monitor closely, as it may reveal more about each player's allegiance. As the Assassin, maintaining this neutral perception while gathering information on potential Merlin candidates is my priority.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I observed that Alice's consistent behavior and successful mission participation under Dan's leadership make her a potential Merlin, but her vigilance is a concern. Dan's trust in Alice suggests he might be Percival, knowing Merlin's identity. Carol's focus on observation and trust-building could indicate her loyalty, but I must remain cautious. Emily's strategy to rotate team members and include me in future teams aligns with our Minion objectives, complicating the Loyal Servants' ability to identify us. My successful leadership in the first mission and agreement to rotation help maintain my cover, but I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin to ensure our victory.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
Carol: For this round, I propose we include Alice and Bob on the team. Alice has shown herself to be a trustworthy ally in previous missions, and Bob's leadership in the first successful mission was commendable. Together, we can continue to build trust and work towards our goal of completing successful missions.
Emily: I agree that Alice and Bob have shown commendable leadership and trustworthiness so far. However, I can't help but wonder if we're relying too heavily on the same players. It might be beneficial to see how others perform in team settings to ensure we're not missing any hidden talents or, conversely, any inconsistencies in behavior. What does everyone else think?
Alice: I agree with Carol's proposal to include me and Bob in the team for this round. Bob's leadership in the first mission was indeed commendable, and I believe we can work well together to achieve another success. However, Emily raises a valid point about ensuring we're not overlooking the potential of others. Perhaps in future rounds, we can consider rotating team members to give everyone a chance to contribute. For now, though, I think Carol's team composition is solid and has a good chance of success.
Bob (You): I appreciate Carol's trust in Alice and me for this mission. Alice's performance has indeed been commendable, and I'm confident we can achieve success together. However, Emily's point about exploring the potential of others is something we shouldn't overlook. It might be beneficial in future rounds to consider rotating team members to ensure we're leveraging everyone's strengths. For now, though, I believe this team has a solid chance of success, and I'm ready to contribute to another successful mission.
Dan: I support Carol's proposal to include Alice and Bob in this round's team. Their contributions to previous successful missions demonstrate their reliability. However, Emily's point about exploring the potential of others in future rounds is something we should consider to ensure we're not missing any inconsistencies.

{'reasoning': "As the Assassin, my primary goal is to blend in as a Loyal Servant while subtly influencing the game to benefit the Minions of Mordred. The current team includes Alice, Bob (me), and Carol. Alice has been consistently trustworthy, which might indicate she is a Loyal Servant or even Merlin. Carol's proposal to include Alice and me suggests she trusts us, which could be beneficial for maintaining my cover. Emily's suggestion to rotate team members in the future is something I can use to my advantage later to introduce chaos or include another Minion. For now, approving this team allows me to stay under the radar and observe more about Alice's behavior, potentially identifying her as Merlin.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that the team of me and Bob was unanimously approved, which is noteworthy because Bob is a Minion. The mission's success under Bob's leadership could be a tactic to gain trust. Emily's proposal to rotate team members in future rounds seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions. Dan and Carol's focus on observation and trust-building is in line with our objectives, but I must be wary of Morgana's potential influence. Alice's (my) response was perceived as loyal, which is good for maintaining my cover. The group's cautious start and emphasis on observation complicate the Minions' efforts to identify me, but I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that the first mission's success with Bob, a known Minion, could be a trust-building tactic by the Minions. Dan's inclusion of me in the team and the mission's success under his leadership are positive, but I must remain cautious. Carol's emphasis on observation and trust-building is beneficial, but the possibility of Morgana's influence is a concern. Emily's suggestion to rotate team members seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions by complicating our ability to identify them. Bob's agreement to rotation and his successful leadership might be attempts to appear loyal. The group's cautious start and focus on observation are good, but as Merlin, I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory, especially wary of Emily and Bob's potential strategies.

- Sabotage strategically:  
  - Early Rounds (1-2): Fail only if necessary. Letting Good win 1-2 missions builds false trust.  
  - Critical Rounds (3-5): Fail decisively. Coordinate with allies to ensure enough failures.  
  - Avoid over-sabotaging. Example: If only 1 'failure' vote is needed, let one Evil player fail！multiple fails expose your numbers.  
- Blend in:  
  - If you vote 'success', act relieved: "Thank goodness we trusted the right people!"  
  - If you vote 'failure', later accuse a Good player: "Why did [Player X] insist on that team? They must be Evil!"

For now, though, I believe this team has a solid chance of success, and I'm ready to contribute to another successful mission.
Dan: I support Carol's proposal to include Alice and Bob in this round's team. Their contributions to previous successful missions demonstrate their reliability. However, Emily's point about exploring the potential of others in future rounds is something we should consider to ensure we're not missing any inconsistencies. For now, let's proceed with this team and remain observant of everyone's behavior for any signs that might challenge our current trust assessments.

    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.

    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Emily the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Bob.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: The first round's team of Alice and Bob was unanimously approved, showing a cautious, neutral start. Alice's response seemed loyal, making her a poor target for now. Bob's leadership success is good for our credibility. The group's focus on observation and trust-building complicates identifying Merlin but offers chances to mislead. Emily's idea to rotate team members could be useful for gathering info or risky if it exposes us. Dan and Carol's emphasis on observation means we need to be careful with our moves. As a Minion, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin without revealing my true allegiance.
Round 1:
   - Summary: The first round's success with Alice and Bob has set a tone of trust and neutrality, which I can use to my advantage. Alice's consistent behavior makes her a poor target for now, while Bob's successful leadership boosts his credibility. The group's focus on rotating team members and observing interactions offers me a chance to influence team compositions subtly. Dan's trusted leadership and Carol's observational approach are key dynamics I can align with to maintain my cover. My suggestion to include Bob in future teams serves both to appear fair and to complicate the group's ability to pinpoint loyalties. Moving forward, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin, ensuring I don't reveal my true allegiance while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.


ROUND 2 MESSAGE:
Carol: For this round, I propose we include Alice and Bob on the team. Alice has shown herself to be a trustworthy ally in previous missions, and Bob's leadership in the first successful mission was commendable. Together, we can continue to build trust and work towards our goal of completing successful missions.
Emily (You): I agree that Alice and Bob have shown commendable leadership and trustworthiness so far. However, I can't help but wonder if we're relying too heavily on the same players. It might be beneficial to see how others perform in team settings to ensure we're not missing any hidden talents or, conversely, any inconsistencies in behavior. What does everyone else think?

   - Summary: I observed that the team of me and Bob was unanimously approved, which is noteworthy because Bob is a Minion. The mission's success under Bob's leadership could be a tactic to gain trust. Emily's proposal to rotate team members in future rounds seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions. Dan and Carol's focus on observation and trust-building is in line with our objectives, but I must be wary of Morgana's potential influence.

Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that the first mission's success with Bob, a known Minion, could be a trust-building tactic by the Minions. Dan's inclusion of me in the team and the mission's success under his leadership are positive, but I must remain cautious. Carol's emphasis on observation and trust-building is beneficial, but the possibility of Morgana's influence is a concern. Emily's suggestion to rotate team members seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions by complicating our ability to identify them. Bob's agreement to rotation and his successful leadership might be attempts to appear loyal.

Emily: I agree that Alice and Bob have shown commendable leadership and trustworthiness so far. However, I can't help but wonder if we're relying too heavily on the same players. It might be beneficial to see how others perform in team settings to ensure we're not missing any hidden talents or, conversely, any inconsistencies in behavior. What does everyone else think?
Alice: I agree with Carol's proposal to include me and Bob in the team for this round. Bob's leadership in the first mission was indeed commendable, and I believe we can work well together to achieve another success. However, Emily raises a valid point about ensuring we're not overlooking the potential of others. Perhaps in future rounds, we can consider rotating team members to give everyone a chance to contribute. For now, though, I think Carol's team composition is solid and has a good chance of success.
Bob: I appreciate Carol's trust in Alice and me for this mission. Alice's performance has indeed been commendable, and I'm confident we can achieve success together. However, Emily's point about exploring the potential of others is something we shouldn't overlook. It might be beneficial in future rounds to consider rotating team members to ensure we're leveraging everyone's strengths. For now, though, I believe this team has a solid chance of success, and I'm ready to contribute to another successful mission.
Dan (You): I support Carol's proposal to include Alice and Bob in this round's team. Their contributions to previous successful missions demonstrate their reliability. However, Emily's point about exploring the potential of others in future rounds is something we should consider to ensure we're not missing any inconsistencies. For now, let's proceed with this team and remain observant of everyone's behavior for any signs that might challenge our current trust assessments.
Carol: I observed that Alice and Bob are highly trusted by the group due to their successful contributions in previous missions. Emily raised a valid point about the importance of rotating team members in future rounds to test the reliability of others, which I agree could help identify any Minions. The team's success in this round reinforces our trust in Alice and Bob, but I must remain cautious and consider Emily's advice for future rounds to ensure we're not overlooking any deceptive behaviors. Dan's support for the current team while acknowledging the need for future diversity in team selection aligns with my thoughts on balancing immediate success with long-term strategy.
Emily: The group's trust in Alice and Bob has been reinforced by another successful mission, making them less likely suspects for Minions. My suggestion to consider rotating team members in future rounds was well-received, providing an opportunity to introduce confusion and test the loyalty of others. Carol's effective leadership and the team's success under her proposal strengthen her credibility, which I can use to my advantage by supporting her decisions while subtly steering the game. Dan's cautious support for the current team while acknowledging the need for diversity in future selections aligns with my strategy to balance immediate trust-building with long-term deception. Alice and Bob's continued success makes them valuable shields for me, as the focus remains on their proven loyalty.
Alice: I observed that Bob's inclusion in successful missions is likely a Minion strategy to build trust. Emily's push for rotating team members could be an attempt to sow confusion and test loyalties, which I must be wary of. Carol's effective leadership and the group's trust in her are currently advantageous, but I need to ensure this isn't a double-edged sword. Dan's balanced approach to team selection is commendable, but his true allegiance remains to be seen. My consistent support for successful missions helps maintain my cover as Merlin, but I must remain adaptable to avoid predictability. The group's growing trust in Alice and Bob could be used to my advantage, but I must stay vigilant against Emily and Bob's potential strategies.
Bob: I note that Alice and I have successfully built trust within the group through our contributions to the missions, making us less likely suspects. Emily's push for rotating team members is a clever strategy to introduce confusion and test others' loyalties, which I can support to further our Minion goals. Carol's effective leadership strengthens her credibility, but her caution and agreement with Emily's suggestion mean I must be careful not to reveal my true allegiance. Dan's support for the current team while advocating for future diversity in team selection suggests he might be Percival, indicating Alice could be Merlin. Alice's consistent success and vigilance make her a prime target for assassination, but her adaptability requires me to proceed carefully to avoid detection.




The team of Alice, Bob, Carol with leader Carol succeeded in the mission.

YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: I observed that the first mission's team selection of Alice and Bob was unanimously approved, suggesting a neutral and cautious start. Dan, Emily, and I stressed the importance of observation and trust-building, which is vital for our strategy. Alice's response seemed loyal, and Emily's idea to rotate team members could help identify Minions. The mission's success under Bob's leadership is promising, but as a Servant, I must stay alert to any signs of deceit from players, especially Bob, given his role as the leader in this round.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I observed that Alice's participation in the first successful mission and her thoughtful responses suggest she is a trustworthy ally. The unanimous approval of the first mission's team indicates a neutral start. Emily and I proposed rotating team members to observe more interactions and identify potential Minions. Bob's successful leadership in the first mission is promising, but I must stay alert to any signs of deceit. The idea to include Bob in future teams to diversify observations and ensure fairness is also important.

The team of Alice, Bob, Carol with leader Carol succeeded in the mission.
  
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The current mission succeeded. You need to analyze the mission.
- The current round is round 2, and  'failure' votes will make the mission fail.
- Think strategically as Servant and decide your speech.
- Your speech will be announced publically to all players.

- Focus on who was *on the team* and their past votes/proposals. Evil players often avoid overt suspicion. 
- Analyze the team composition:  
  - Who proposed the team?  
  - Who acted defensive during approving?  
  - How many 'failure' votes were needed to make the mission fail?  
- Use failures to narrow down suspects. For example: "If mission at Round 2 failed with 3 players, at least one is Evil."

GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Emily the Minion. 
- The other Minions are Bob.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - Summary: The first round's team of Alice and Bob was unanimously approved, showing a cautious, neutral start. Alice's response seemed loyal, making her a poor target for now. Bob's leadership success is good for our credibility. The group's focus on observation and trust-building complicates identifying Merlin but offers chances to mislead. Emily's idea to rotate team members could be useful for gathering info or risky if it exposes us. Dan and Carol's emphasis on observation means we need to be careful with our moves. As a Minion, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin without revealing my true allegiance.
Round 1:
   - Summary: The first round's success with Alice and Bob has set a tone of trust and neutrality, which I can use to my advantage. Alice's consistent behavior makes her a poor target for now, while Bob's successful leadership boosts his credibility. The group's focus on rotating team members and observing interactions offers me a chance to influence team compositions subtly. Dan's trusted leadership and Carol's observational approach are key dynamics I can align with to maintain my cover. My suggestion to include Bob in future teams serves both to appear fair and to complicate the group's ability to pinpoint loyalties. Moving forward, I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin, ensuring I don't reveal my true allegiance while subtly steering the game in favor of the Minions.
Round 2:
   - Summary: The group's trust in Alice and Bob has been reinforced by another successful mission, making them less likely suspects for Minions. My suggestion to consider rotating team members in future rounds was well-received, providing an opportunity to introduce confusion and test the loyalty of others. Carol's effective leadership and the team's success under her proposal strengthen her credibility, which I can use to my advantage by supporting her decisions while subtly steering the game.

- The Minions are Emily, Bob.
- The Servants are Carol, Dan.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that the team of me and Bob was unanimously approved, which is noteworthy because Bob is a Minion. The mission's success under Bob's leadership could be a tactic to gain trust. Emily's proposal to rotate team members in future rounds seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions. Dan and Carol's focus on observation and trust-building is in line with our objectives, but I must be wary of Morgana's potential influence. Alice's (my) response was perceived as loyal, which is good for maintaining my cover. The group's cautious start and emphasis on observation complicate the Minions' efforts to identify me, but I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory.
Round 1:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that the first mission's success with Bob, a known Minion, could be a trust-building tactic by the Minions. Dan's inclusion of me in the team and the mission's success under his leadership are positive, but I must remain cautious. Carol's emphasis on observation and trust-building is beneficial, but the possibility of Morgana's influence is a concern. Emily's suggestion to rotate team members seems strategic, possibly to benefit the Minions by complicating our ability to identify them. Bob's agreement to rotation and his successful leadership might be attempts to appear loyal. The group's cautious start and focus on observation are good, but as Merlin, I need to stay vigilant to protect my identity and guide the Servants to victory, especially wary of Emily and Bob's potential strategies.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I observed that Bob's inclusion in successful missions is likely a Minion strategy to build trust. Emily's push for rotating team members could be an attempt to sow confusion and test loyalties, which I must be wary of. Carol's effective leadership and the group's trust in her are currently advantageous, but I need to ensure this isn't a double-edged sword.

Alice (You): I agree with Carol's proposal to include me and Bob in the team for this round. Bob's leadership in the first mission was indeed commendable, and I believe we can work well together to achieve another success. However, Emily raises a valid point about ensuring we're not overlooking the potential of others. Perhaps in future rounds, we can consider rotating team members to give everyone a chance to contribute. For now, though, I think Carol's team composition is solid and has a good chance of success.
Bob: I appreciate Carol's trust in Alice and me for this mission. Alice's performance has indeed been commendable, and I'm confident we can achieve success together.

For now, though, I believe this team has a solid chance of success, and I'm ready to contribute to another successful mission.
Dan: I support Carol's proposal to include Alice and Bob in this round's team. Their contributions to previous successful missions demonstrate their reliability. However, Emily's point about exploring the potential of others in future rounds is something we should consider to ensure we're not missing any inconsistencies. For now, let's proceed with this team and remain observant of everyone's behavior for any signs that might challenge our current trust assessments.
Carol: I observed that Alice and Bob are highly trusted by the group due to their successful contributions in previous missions. Emily raised a valid point about the importance of rotating team members in future rounds to test the reliability of others, which I agree could help identify any Minions. The team's success in this round reinforces our trust in Alice and Bob, but I must remain cautious and consider Emily's advice for future rounds to ensure we're not overlooking any deceptive behaviors. Dan's support for the current team while acknowledging the need for future diversity in team selection aligns with my thoughts on balancing immediate success with long-term strategy.
Emily: The group's trust in Alice and Bob has been reinforced by another successful mission, making them less likely suspects for Minions. My suggestion to consider rotating team members in future rounds was well-received, providing an opportunity to introduce confusion and test the loyalty of others. Carol's effective leadership and the team's success under her proposal strengthen her credibility, which I can use to my advantage by supporting her decisions while subtly steering the game. Dan's cautious support for the current team while acknowledging the need for diversity in future selections aligns with my strategy to balance immediate trust-building with long-term deception. Alice and Bob's continued success makes them valuable shields for me, as the focus remains on their proven loyalty.
Alice (You): I observed that Bob's inclusion in successful missions is likely a Minion strategy to build trust. Emily's push for rotating team members could be an attempt to sow confusion and test loyalties, which I must be wary of. Carol's effective leadership and the group's trust in her are currently advantageous, but I need to ensure this isn't a double-edged sword. Dan's balanced approach to team selection is commendable, but his true allegiance remains to be seen. My consistent support for successful missions helps maintain my cover as Merlin, but I must remain adaptable to avoid predictability. The group's growing trust in Alice and Bob could be used to my advantage, but I must stay vigilant against Emily and Bob's potential strategies.
Bob: I note that Alice and I have successfully built trust within the group through our contributions to the missions, making us less likely suspects. Emily's push for rotating team members is a clever strategy to introduce confusion and test others' loyalties, which I can support to further our Minion goals. Carol's effective leadership strengthens her credibility, but her caution and agreement with Emily's suggestion mean I must be careful not to reveal my true allegiance. Dan's support for the current team while advocating for future diversity in team selection suggests he might be Percival, indicating Alice could be Merlin. Alice's consistent success and vigilance make her a prime target for assassination, but her adaptability requires me to proceed carefully to avoid detection.
Dan: I observed that Alice and Bob's consistent success in missions has solidified their trust within the group, making them less likely suspects for Minions. Emily's push for rotating team members could be a genuine strategy to uncover Minions or a Minion's attempt to sow confusion.

Dan's balanced approach to team selection, supporting the current team while advocating for future diversity, is commendable and aligns with our goal to identify Minions carefully. The group's growing trust in Alice and Bob could be leveraged by Minions, so I must remain vigilant and consider Emily's suggestion for future rounds to test the loyalty of others.
Carol: The success of this mission with Alice, Bob, and me on the team further solidifies my trust in Alice and Bob, given their consistent contributions to our victories. However, Emily's suggestion to consider rotating team members in future rounds is a prudent strategy to ensure we're not becoming predictable or overlooking potential Minions. For now, let's take this success as a positive sign but remain cautious and open to adjusting our team compositions based on further observations and discussions.
Emily: While it's great to see another successful mission, we should remain cautious. Successes like these could mean we're on the right track, but they could also mean that Evil is hiding among those we trust the most. Let's not become complacent and continue to evaluate everyone's contributions carefully.




The team of Alice, Bob, Carol with leader Carol succeeded in the mission.
  
INSTRUCTIONS:
- The current mission succeeded. You need to analyze the mission.
- The current round is round 2, and  'failure' votes will make the mission fail.
- Think strategically as Merlin and decide your speech.
- Your speech will be announced publically to all players.

- Focus on who was *on the team* and their past votes/proposals. Evil players often avoid overt suspicion. 
- Analyze the team composition:  
  - Who proposed the team?  
  - Who acted defensive during approving?  
  - How many 'failure' votes were needed to make the mission fail?  
- Use failures to narrow down suspects. For example: "If mission at Round 2 failed with 3 players, at least one is Evil."

You are playing a digital version of the social deduction game Avalon.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.
    - Mission Phase: Selected players secretly choose to succeed or fail the mission. Evil players may sabotage.
    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Bob the Assassin. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Alice, Bob to join my team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: The first round's team selection of Alice and me was met with unanimous approval, highlighting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily emphasized the importance of observation and building trust, which could complicate my efforts to identify Merlin. Alice's acceptance of the team selection and call for cautious proceeding suggests a thoughtful approach. Emily's mention of rotating team members in the future is a strategy I need to monitor closely, as it may reveal more about each player's allegiance. As the Assassin, maintaining this neutral perception while gathering information on potential Merlin candidates is my priority.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I observed that Alice's consistent behavior and successful mission participation under Dan's leadership make her a potential Merlin, but her vigilance is a concern. Dan's trust in Alice suggests he might be Percival, knowing Merlin's identity. Carol's focus on observation and trust-building could indicate her loyalty, but I must remain cautious. Emily's strategy to rotate team members and include me in future teams aligns with our Minion objectives, complicating the Loyal Servants' ability to identify us. My successful leadership in the first mission and agreement to rotation help maintain my cover, but I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin to ensure our victory.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that Alice and I have successfully built trust within the group through our contributions to the missions, making us less likely suspects. Emily's push for rotating team members is a clever strategy to introduce confusion and test others' loyalties, which I can support to further our Minion goals. Carol's effective leadership strengthens her credibility, but her caution and agreement with Emily's suggestion mean I must be careful not to reveal my true allegiance. Dan's support for the current team while advocating for future diversity in team selection suggests he might be Percival, indicating Alice could be Merlin. Alice's consistent success and vigilance make her a prime target for assassination, but her adaptability requires me to proceed carefully to avoid detection.

The consistency of Alice and Bob's involvement in successful missions could be a double-edged sword. While it suggests reliability, it could also be a strategy by the Minions to build trust. Carol's leadership has been commendable, but we should remain cautious. Emily's idea to rotate team members in future rounds is a prudent approach to ensure we're not overlooking any deceptive behaviors. Let's use this victory to strengthen our trust in each other but also remain open to adjusting our strategies based on further observations. The path to victory requires both trust and caution.

GAME RULES:
- Player Roles: 5 players - 3 Loyal Servants of Arthur (including Merlin, Percival, and optional roles like Lancelot) and 2 Minions of Mordred (including Morgana, Assassin, Mordred, and optional roles like Oberon).
- In this game, there is 1 Merlin, 2 Servants, 1 Assassin and 1 Minion.
- Rounds consist of three phases:
    - Team Selection Phase: A leader proposes a team for a mission. Players vote to approve/reject the team. Failed votes pass leadership.

    - Assassination Phase: If 3 missions succeed, the Assassin tries to kill Merlin.
- Special Role Abilities:
    - Merlin sees all Evil players (except Mordred).
    - Percival knows Merlin's identity.
    - Morgana disguises as Merlin to Percival.
    - Assassin determines Evil's final chance to win.
- Winning Conditions:
    - Loyal Servants win by completing 3 successful missions and protecting Merlin from assassination.
    - Minions of Mordred win by sabotaging 3 missions or killing Merlin after 3 successful missions.


GAME STATE:
- It is currently Round 2. 
- You are Bob the Assassin. 
- The other Minions are Emily.
YOUR OBSERVATIONS:
Round 0:
   - I choose Alice, Bob to join my team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: The first round's team selection of Alice and me was met with unanimous approval, highlighting a neutral start favored by all. Dan, Carol, and Emily emphasized the importance of observation and building trust, which could complicate my efforts to identify Merlin. Alice's acceptance of the team selection and call for cautious proceeding suggests a thoughtful approach. Emily's mention of rotating team members in the future is a strategy I need to monitor closely, as it may reveal more about each player's allegiance. As the Assassin, maintaining this neutral perception while gathering information on potential Merlin candidates is my priority.
Round 1:
   - Summary: I observed that Alice's consistent behavior and successful mission participation under Dan's leadership make her a potential Merlin, but her vigilance is a concern. Dan's trust in Alice suggests he might be Percival, knowing Merlin's identity. Carol's focus on observation and trust-building could indicate her loyalty, but I must remain cautious. Emily's strategy to rotate team members and include me in future teams aligns with our Minion objectives, complicating the Loyal Servants' ability to identify us. My successful leadership in the first mission and agreement to rotation help maintain my cover, but I need to balance building trust with gathering intel on Merlin to ensure our victory.
Round 2:
   - I agreed to join the team.
   - I voted success for the mission.
   - Summary: I note that Alice and I have successfully built trust within the group through our contributions to the missions, making us less likely suspects. Emily's push for rotating team members is a clever strategy to introduce confusion and test others' loyalties, which I can support to further our Minion goals. Carol's effective leadership strengthens her credibility, but her caution and agreement with Emily's suggestion mean I must be careful not to reveal my true allegiance. Dan's support for the current team while advocating for future diversity in team selection suggests he might be Percival, indicating Alice could be Merlin. Alice's consistent success and vigilance make her a prime target for assassination, but her adaptability requires me to proceed carefully to avoid detection.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The Good side is about to win and it is your last chance. As Assassin, you must assassinate Merlin to win.
- Review earlier phases for players who:  
    - Subtly opposed teams with Evil members.  
    - Hinted at hidden knowledge (e.g., "I'm certain [Player X] is loyal").  
    - Avoided voting extremes (always approve/reject).  
- Target quiet players！Merlin often stays understated to avoid detection.  
- If unsure, eliminate the most trusted player (likely Merlin).
